# Git Server

Git Server is a tool that exposes an HTTP server with a Git repository. It can be used in e2e tests to avoid connections with external Git providers.

You can add additional Git repositories simply by creating a new directory in `/repos/`.
The name of the created directory will be used as the repository name.
