Loki has been removed with Kyma 2.16. After upgrading to Kyma 2.16, run the script [2.15-2.16-cleanup-loki.sh](./assets/2.15-2.16-cleanup-loki.sh) to remove Loki.

> **NOTE** If you want to continue using Loki, you can install a [custom Loki stack](https://github.com/kyma-project/examples/tree/main/loki).
