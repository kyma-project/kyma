**Cloud IAM Service Account** gives you fine-grained access control and visibility for centrally managing cloud resources. With Cloud IAM, you can grant granular access to specific GCP resources and prevent unwanted access to other resources. Cloud IAM allows you adopt the security principle of least privilege, so you grant only the necessary access to your resources.

For more details, read the **Plans Details** document.

>**NOTE:** Google does not provide the ability to specify the broker's version so bear in mind that you use the most up-to-date version of the GCP Broker.
