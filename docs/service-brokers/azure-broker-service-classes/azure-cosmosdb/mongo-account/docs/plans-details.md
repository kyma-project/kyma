| **resourceGroup** | `string` | The (new or existing) resource group with which to associate new resources. | Yes |  |
| **tags** | `map[string]string` | Tags to be applied to new resources, specified as key/value pairs. | No | Tags (even if none are specified) are automatically supplemented with `heritage: open-service-broker-azure`. |
| **ipFilters** | `object` | IP Range Filter to be applied to new CosmosDB account | No | A default filter is created that allows only Azure service access |
| **ipFilters.allowAccessFromAzure** | `string` | Specifies if Azure Services should be able to access the CosmosDB account. Valid valued are `""` (unspecified), `enabled`, or `disabled`. | No | If left unspecified, defaults to enabled. |
| **ipFilters.allowAccessFromPortal** | `string` | Specifies if the Azure Portal should be able to access the CosmosDB account. If `allowAccessFromAzure` is set to enabled, this value is ignored. Valid valued are `""` (unspecified), `enabled`, or `disabled`. | No | If left unspecified, defaults to enabled. |

| **consistencyPolicy** | `object` | The consistency policy for the Cosmos DB account. | No | |
| **consistencyPolicy.defaultConsistencyLevel** | `string` | The default consistency level and configuration settings of the Cosmos DB account. - Eventual, Session, BoundedStaleness, Strong, ConsistentPrefix | Yes | |
| **consistencyPolicy.maxStalenessPrefix** | `integer` | When used with the Bounded Staleness consistency level, this value represents the number of stale requests tolerated. Accepted range for this value is 1 â€“ 2,147,483,647. Required when defaultConsistencyPolicy is set to 'BoundedStaleness'. | No | |
| **consistencyPolicy.maxIntervalInSeconds** | `integer` | When used with the Bounded Staleness consistency level, this value represents the time amount of staleness (in seconds) tolerated.
