Messages are sent to and received from queues. Queues enable you to store messages until the receiving application is available to receive and process them.
Messages in queues are ordered and timestamped on arrival. Once accepted, the message is held safely in redundant storage. Messages are delivered in pull mode, which delivers messages on request.
