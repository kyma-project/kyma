Topics are useful in publish/subscribe scenarios. Topics can have multiple, independent subscriptions. A subscriber to a topic can receive a copy of each message sent to that topic. Subscriptions are named entities, which are durably created but can optionally expire or auto-delete.

>**NOTE:** This version of the service is based on [Open Service Broker for Azure](https://github.com/Azure/open-service-broker-azure).
