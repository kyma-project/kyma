The Open Service Broker for Azure contains the **Azure PostgreSQL Database** service shown:

| Service Type                  | Description                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `azure-postgresql-9.6`          | Provision both an Azure Database for PostgreSQL Database Management System (DBMS) and a database. |

The `azure-postgresql-9.6` services allow you to provision both a DBMS and a database. When the provision operation is successful, the database will be ready to use. You can not provision additional databases onto an instance provisioned through these two services.

>**NOTE:** This version of the service is based on [Open Service Broker for Azure](https://github.com/Azure/open-service-broker-azure).
