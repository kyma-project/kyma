Knative Eventing Mesh uses the [Knative Eventing](https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/) components to build an eventing solution that provides event routing and ensures the event delivery between the source and consumer.
Eventing Mesh uses [Knative Broker and Trigger](https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/broker-trigger/) CRDs to make sure that events can come from different sources, and that subscribers receive exactly those events they want to. 
This way, the process of event publishing and consumption runs smoother, thus significantly improving the overall performance.
