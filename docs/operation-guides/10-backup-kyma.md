title: Back up Kyma
type: Backups
---
The Kyma cluster load consists of Kubernetes [objects](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/) and [volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/). 

Kyma relies on a managed Kubernetes cluster for periodic backups of Kubernetes objects to avoid any manual steps.

>**CAUTION:** Automatic backup does not include Kubernetes volumes. Back up your volumes periodically either on demand, or set up a periodic job.

## Object backup

For example, Gardener uses [etcd](https://etcd.io/) as the Kubernetes backing store for all cluster data. Gardener runs periodic jobs to take major and minor snapshots of the etcd database to include Kubernetes objects in the backup. 

The major snapshot that includes all resources is taken on a daily basis, while minor snapshots are taken every five minutes. 

If the etcd database experiences any problems, Gardener automatically restores the Kubernetes cluster using the most recent snapshot.

## Volume backup

You should back up your volumes periodically with the [VolumeSnapshot API resource](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-snapshots/#volumesnapshots), which is provided by Kubernetes. You can use your snapshot to provision a new volume pre-populated with the snapshot data or restore the existing volume to the state represented by the snapshot.

Taking volume snapshots is possible thanks to [Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/) which allow third-party storage providers to expose storage systems in Kubernetes. For details on available drivers, see the [full list of drivers](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/drivers.html).
