## Kyma Installer doesn't respond as expected

If the Installer does not respond as expected, check the installation status using the `is-installed.sh` script with the `--verbose` flag added. Run:

```bash
scripts/is-installed.sh --verbose
```

## Component doesn't work after successful installation

If the installation is successful but a component does not behave in the expected way, inspect Helm releases for more details on all of the installed components.

Run this command to list all available Helm releases:

```bash
helm list --all-namespaces --all
```

Run this command to get more detailed information about a given release:

```bash
helm status {RELEASE_NAME} -n {RELEASE_NAMESPACE}
```

>**NOTE:** Names of Helm releases correspond to names of Kyma components.


Additionally, see if all deployed Pods are running. Run this command:

```bash
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
```

The command retrieves all Pods from all Namespaces, the status of the Pods, and their instance numbers. Check if the status is `Running` for all Pods. If any of the Pods that you require do not start successfully, install Kyma again.
