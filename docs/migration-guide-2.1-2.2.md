 - Are there cases when I shouldn't run it ?

When you upgrade from Kyma 2.1 to 2.2, either run the script [`2.1-2.2-fix-delete-orphaned-resources.sh`](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/blob/release-2.1/docs/assets/2.1-2.2-fix-delete-orphaned-resources.sh) found in [`/assets`](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/tree/release-2.2/docs/assets) or perform the required steps from that script manually.
