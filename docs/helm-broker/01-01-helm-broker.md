The Helm Broker is a [Service Broker](/components/service-catalog/#service-brokers-overview) which exposes Helm charts as Service Classes in the Service Catalog. To do so, the Helm Broker uses the concept of bundles. Bundles are abstraction layers over Helm charts which provide all necessary information to convert the charts into Service Classes.

The Helm Broker fetches bundles which contain a set of specific [files](#details-create-a-bundle). You must place your bundles in a repository of an appropriate [format](#details-create-a-bundles-repository). By default, the Helm Broker fetches bundles from the release of the [`bundles`](https://github.com/kyma-project/bundles/releases) repository. You can also [configure](#configuration-configuration) the Helm Broker to fetch bundle definitions from any remote HTTP server.

In Kyma, you can use bundles to install the following Service Brokers:

* [Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Broker](/components/service-catalog/#service-brokers-gcp-broker)
* [Azure Service Broker](/components/service-catalog/#service-brokers-azure-service-broker)
* [AWS Service Broker](/components/service-catalog/#service-brokers-aws-service-broker)

To get all the bundles that the Helm Broker provides, go to the [`bundles`](https://github.com/kyma-project/bundles) repository.

The Helm Broker implements the [Open Service Broker API](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.14/profile.md#service-metadata) (OSB API).
To be compliant with the Service Catalog version used in Kyma, the Helm Broker supports only the following OSB API versions:
- v2.13
- v2.12
- v2.11

> **NOTE:** The Helm Broker does not implement the OSB API update operation.
