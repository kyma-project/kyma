title: Create addons repository
type: Details
---

The repository in which you create your own addons must contain at least one `index.yaml` file and have a specific structure, depending on the type of server that exposes your addons.

## The index yaml file

Your remote addons repository can contain many addons defined in index files. Depending on your needs and preferences, you can create one or more index files to categorize your addons. In the index file, provide an entry for every single addon from your addons repository. The index file must have the following structure:
```
apiVersion: v1
entries:
  {addon_name}:
    - name: {addon_name}
      description: {addon_description}
      version: {addon_version}
```

See the example:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
entries:
  redis:
    - name: redis
      description: Redis service
      version: 0.0.1
```

>**NOTE:** You must place your addons in the same directory where the `index.yaml` file is stored.

## Supported protocols

Expose your addons repository so that you can provide URLs in the [AddonsConfiguration](#custom-resource-addonsconfiguration) (AC) and [ClusterAddonsConfiguration](#custom-resource-clusteraddonsconfiguration) (CAC) custom resources. The Helm Broker supports exposing addons using the following protocols:

  <summary>
  HTTP/HTTPS
  </summary>

>**NOTE:** The HTTP protocol is supported only in `DevelopMode`. To learn more, read [this](#details-registration-rules-using-http-urls) document.

If you want to use an HTTP or HTTPS server, you must compress your addons to `.tgz` files. The repository structure looks as follows:
```
sample-addon-repository
  ├── {addon_x_name}-{addon_x_version}.tgz           # An addon compressed to a .tgz file
  ├── {addon_y_name}-{addon_y_version}.tgz        
  ├── ...                                      
  ├── index.yaml                                     # A file which defines available addons
  ├── index-2.yaml                              
  └── ...                                                    
```

See the example of the Kyma `addons` repository [here](https://github.com/kyma-project/addons/releases).

>**TIP:** If you contribute to the Kyma [`addons`](https://github.com/kyma-project/addons/tree/master/addons) repository, you do not have to compress your addons as the system does it automatically.

These are the allowed addon repository URLs provided in CAC or AC custom resources for HTTP or HTTPS servers:
```yaml
apiVersion: addons.kyma-project.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterAddonsConfiguration
metadata:
  name: addons-cfg-sample
spec:
  repositories:
    # HTTPS protocol
    - url: "https://github.com/kyma-project/addons/releases/download/latest/index.yaml"
    # HTTP protocol
    - url: "http://github.com/kyma-project/addons/releases/download/latest/index.yaml"
```

  <summary>
  Git
  </summary>

If you want to use Git, place your addons directly in addons directories. The repository structure looks as follows:
```
sample-addon-repository
  ├── {addon_x_name}-{addon_x_version}               # An addon directory
  ├── {addon_y_name}-{addon_y_version}        
  ├── ...                                      
  ├── index.yaml                                     # A file which defines available addons
  ├── index-2.yaml                              
  └── ...                                                    
```

See the example of the Kyma `addons` repository [here](https://github.com/kyma-project/addons/tree/master/addons).


You can specify a Git repository URL by adding a special `git::` prefix to the URL address. After this prefix, provide any valid Git URL with one of the protocols supported by Git. In the URL, you can specify a branch, commit, or tag version. You can also add the `depth` query parameter with a number that specifies the last revision you want to clone from the repository.

>**NOTE:** If you use `depth` together with `ref`, make sure that `depth` number is big enough to clone a proper reference. For example, if you have `depth=1` and `ref` set to a commit from the distant past, the URL will not work as you clone only the first commit from the `master` branch and there is no option to do the checkout.

These are the allowed addon repository URLs provided in CAC or AC custom resources for Git:
```yaml
apiVersion: addons.kyma-project.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterAddonsConfiguration
metadata:
  name: addons-cfg-sample
spec:
  repositories:
    # Git HTTPS protocol with a path to index.yaml
    - url: "git::https://github.com/kyma-project/addons.git//addons/index.yaml"
    # Git HTTPS protocol with a path to index.yaml of a specified version and a depth query parameter
    - url: "git::https://github.com/kyma-project/addons.git//addons/index.yaml?ref=1.2.0&depth=3"
    # github.com URL with no prefix. It is automatically interpreted as a Git repository source.
    - url: "github.com/kyma-project/addons//addons/index.yaml"
    # bitbucket.org URL with no prefix. It is automatically interpreted as a Git repository source.
    - url: "bitbucket.org/kyma-project/addons//addons/index.yaml"
```

  </details>
</div>

## Authorization

The AddonsConfiguration and ClusterAddonsConfiguration custom resources allow you to define authorization as part of the URL. For more details, read the [go-getter protocols](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter/blob/master/README.md#general-all-protocols) description.
Using sensitive information, such as passwords, directly in the URL is not a good approach. Avoid this by putting such data in a Secret resource and taking advantage of templating. Use placeholders which refer to keys in the Secret. For example:
```yaml
apiVersion: addons.kyma-project.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterAddonsConfiguration
metadata:
  name: addons-cfg-sample
spec:
  repositories:
    - url: "https://{host}/{project}/addons/index.yaml"
      secretRef:
        name: data
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: data
type: Opaque
stringData:
  host: "github.com"
  project: "kyma-project/addons"       
```
The URL resolves into: 
```
https://github.com/kyma-project/addons/addons/index.yaml
```

The Helm Broker supports authorization using these protocols:
 
<div tabs>
  <details>
  <summary>
  HTTP/HTTPS
  </summary> 
 
To define basic authentication credentials, prepend a section `username:password@` to the hostname in the URL . For example:
```
https://admin:secretPassword@repository.addons.com/index.yaml
```

Create a Secret resource which contains credentials, and reference it in the repository URL definition using templating:

Create a Secret:
```bash
kubectl create secret generic auth -n stage --from-literal=username=admin --from-literal=password=secretPassword
```

Define a ClusterAddonsConfiguration:
```yaml
apiVersion: addons.kyma-project.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterAddonsConfiguration
metadata:
  name: addons-cfg-sample
spec:
  repositories:
    # HTTPS protocol with basic authorization provided.
    - url: "https://{username}:{password}@repository.addons.com/index.yaml"
      secretRef:
        name: auth
        namespace: stage     
```

  </details>
  <details>
  <summary>
  Git SSH
  </summary>
  
  The Git SSH protocol requires an SSH key to authorize with your repository. Setting SSH keys differs among hosting providers. 
  > **NOTE**: See [this](https://help.github.com/en/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key) document to read about the GitHub service. 
  
  The private key must be base64 encoded.
  
  To encode your private key, run this command:
  ```bash
    base64 -b -i {path_to_id_rsa} -o id_rsa-encoded
  ```
  
  > **NOTE:** Private SSH key should not be secured by a passphrase.

  Create a corresponding Secret resource:
  ```bash
  kubectl create secret generic auth -n stage --from-file=key=id_rsa-encoded
  ```
  Define a URL with the required sshkey option:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: addons.kyma-project.io/v1alpha1
  kind: ClusterAddonsConfiguration
  metadata:
    name: addons-cfg-sample
  spec:
    repositories:
      # Git SSH protocol with a reference to a secret containing base64 encoded SSH private key
      - url: "git::ssh://git@github.com/kyma-project/private-addons.git//addons/index.yaml?sshkey={key}"
        secretRef:
          name: auth
          namespace: stage
  ```
