title: Create addons repository
type: Details
---

The repository in which you create your own addons must have a specific structure and be exposed as an HTTPS server so that the Helm Broker can fetch addons from it. Your remote addons repository can contain many addons, each one compressed to the `.tgz` format and defined in `index.yaml` files. Depending on your needs and preferences, you can create one or more `index.yaml` files to categorize your addons. The repository structure looks as follows:

```
sample-addon-repository
  ├── {addon_x_name}-{addon_x_version}.tgz           # An addon compressed to a .tgz file
  ├── {addon_y_name}-{addon_y_version}.tgz        
  ├── ...                                      
  ├── index.yaml                                     # A file which defines available addons
  ├── index-2.yaml                              
  └── ...                                                    
```

Read [this](https://github.com/kyma-project/addons/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) document to learn how to set up your own addons repository which generates `.tgz` and `index.yaml` files, and expose them using an HTTPS server. See the example of the Kyma `addons` repository [here](https://github.com/kyma-project/addons/releases).

## The addon .tgz file

The `{addon_name}-{addon_version}.tgz` file is a compressed version of your addon. To learn how to create your own addon, read [this](#details-create-addons) document.

>**TIP:** If you contribute to the [addons](https://github.com/kyma-project/addons/tree/master/addons) repository, you do not have to compress your addons as the system does it automatically.

## The index.yaml file

In the `index.yaml` file, provide an entry for every single addon from your addons repository. The `index.yaml` file must have the following structure:

```
apiVersion: v1
entries:
  {addon_name}:
    - name: {addon_name}
      description: {addon_description}
      version: {addon_version}
```

See the example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
entries:
  redis:
    - name: redis
      description: Redis service
      version: 0.0.1
```
