Observability tools should clearly show the big picture, no matter if they help you monitor just a couple or multiple components. In a cloud-native microservice architecture, a user request often flows through dozens of different microservices. Tools such as logging or monitoring help to track the way, however, they treat each component or microservice in isolation. This individual treatment results in operational issues. 

Distributed tracing charts out the transactions in cloud-native systems, helping you to understand the application behavior and relations between the front end actions and back end implementation. 

The diagram shows how the distributed tracing helps to track the request path.
