The micro-services based architecture differs from the traditional monoliths in many aspects. From the request observability perspective, there are asynchronous boundaries among various different micro-services that compose a request flow. Moreover, these micro-services can have heterogeneous semantics when it comes to monitoring and observability. It is required to have a tracing solution that can provide a holistic view of the request flow and help the developer understand the system better to take informed decisions regarding troubleshooting and performance optimization.

Tracing in Kyma uses [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/) as a backend which serves as the query mechanism for displaying information about traces. Jaeger is used for monitoring and troubleshooting microservice-based distributed systems, including:

- Distributed context propagation
- Distributed transaction monitoring
- Root cause analysis
- Service dependency analysis
- Performance and latency optimization

Jaeger provides compatibility with the Zipkin protocol. The compatibility makes it possible to use Zipkin protocol and clients in Istio, Envoy, and Kyma services.
