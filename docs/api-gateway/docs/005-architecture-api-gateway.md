This diagram illustrates the workflow that leads to exposing a service in Kyma:

- **API Controller** is a component responsible for exposing services. The API Controller is an application deployed in the `kyma-system` Namespace, implemented according to the [Kubernetes Operator](https://coreos.com/blog/introducing-operators.html) principles. The API Controller listens for newly created custom resources (CR) that follow the set `api.gateway.kyma-project.io` CustomResourceDefinition (CRD), which describes the details of exposing services in Kyma.

- **Istio Virtual Service** is used to specify the services that are visible outside the cluster. The API Controller creates a Virtual Service for the hostname defined in the `api.gateway.kyma-project.io` CRD. The convention is to create a hostname using the name of the service as the subdomain, and the domain of the Kyma cluster. To learn more about the Istio Virtual Service concept, read this [Istio documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/).
To get the list of Virtual Services in Kyma, run:
```
kubectl get virtualservices.networking.istio.io --all-namespaces
```

- **Istio Authentication Policy** allows operators to specify authentication requirements for a service. It is an optional resource, created only when the CR specifies the desired authentication method, the token issuer, and the JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint URI. You can secure services using the `JWT` authentication method. You can specify multiple JWT issuers to allow to access the service with tokens from different ID providers. For more details, see the **Security** document.
The JWKS endpoint is used to fetch cryptographic keys, which allow to verify the ID token signature. Services exposed through a CR with the **authentication** section specified require valid ID tokens to access them. To learn more about the Istio Authentication Policy, read this [Istio security documentation](https://istio.io/docs/concepts/security/authn-policy/).
To get the list of Istio Authentication Policies created in Kyma, run:
```
kubectl get policies.authentication.istio.io --all-namespaces
```
