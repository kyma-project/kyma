title: OAuth2 and OpenID Connect server
type: Details
---

By default, every Kyma deployment comes with an OAuth2 authorization server solution from [ORY](https://www.ory.sh/). The `ory` [component](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/tree/master/resources/ory) consists of four elements:

- [Hydra](https://github.com/ory/hydra) OAuth2 and OpenID Connect server which issues access, refresh, and ID tokens to registered clients which call services in a Kyma cluster.
- [Oathkeeper](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper) authorization & authentication proxy which authenticates and authorizes incoming requests basing on the list of defined [Access Rules](https://www.ory.sh/docs/oathkeeper/api-access-rules).
- [Oathkeeper Maester](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper-maester) Kubernetes controller which feeds Access Rules to the Oathkeeper proxy by creating or updating the Oathkeeper ConfigMap and populating it with rules found in instances of the `rules.oathkeeper.ory.sh/v1alpha1` custom resource.
- [Hydra Maester](https://github.com/ory/hydra-maester) Kubernetes controller which manages OAuth2 clients by communicating the data found in instances of the `oauth2clients.hydra.ory.sh` custom resource to the ORY Hydra API.

Out of the box, the Kyma implementation of the ORY stack supports the [OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/client-credentials/).

>**NOTE:** The implementation of the ORY Oauth2 server in Kyma is still in the early stages and is subject to changes and development. Read [this](https://kyma-project.io/blog/2019/7/31/kyma-collaboration-with-ory/) blog post to get a better understanding of the target integration of the ORY stack in Kyma.

## Register an OAuth2 client

To interact with the Kyma OAuth2 server, you must register an OAuth2 client. Run this command to create a custom resource that triggers the creation of a client:

```
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: hydra.ory.sh/v1alpha1
kind: OAuth2Client
metadata:
  name: {NAME_OF_CLIENT}
  namespace: {CLIENT_NAMESPACE}
spec:
  grantTypes:
    - "client_credentials"
  scope: "read write"
EOF
```

Creating this custom resource triggers the Hydra Maester controller which sends a client registration request to the OAuth2 server and saves the credentials of the registered client to a Kubernetes Secret.
>**NOTE:** The instance of the`oauth2clients.hydra.ory.sh` custom resource and the Secret that stores the credentials of the corresponding client share the name and the Namespace.

Run this command to get the credentials of the registered OAuth2:
```
kubectl get secret -n {CLIENT_NAMESPACE} {NAME_OF_CLIENT} -o yaml
```

See the ORY Hydra Maester [Github page](https://github.com/ory/hydra-maester) to learn more about the `oauth2clients.hydra.ory.sh` custom resource.


## OAuth2 server in action

After you register an OAuth2 client, go to [this](https://github.com/kyma-incubator/examples/tree/master/ory-hydra/scenarios/client-credentials) Kyma Incubator repository to try a Client Credentials Grant example that showcases the integration.

You can also interact with the OAuth2 server using its REST API. Read the official [ORY documentation](https://www.ory.sh/docs/hydra/sdk/api) to learn more about the available endpoints.

>**TIP:** If you have any questions about the ORY-Kyma integration, you can ask them on the **#security** [Slack channel](http://slack.kyma-project.io/) and get answers directly from Kyma developers.
