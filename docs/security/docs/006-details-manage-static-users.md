## Create a new static user

To create a static user in Dex, create a Secret with the **dex-user-config** label set to `true`. Run:

```
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name:  {SECRET_NAME}
  namespace: {SECRET_NAMESPACE}
  labels:
    "dex-user-config": "true"
data:
  email: {BASE64_USER_EMAIL}
  username: {BASE64_USERNAME}
  password: {BASE64_USER_PASSWORD}  
type: Opaque
EOF
```
>**NOTE:** If you don't specify the Namespace in which you want to create the Secret, the system creates it in the `default` Namespace.

The following table describes the fields that are mandatory to create a static user. If you don't include any of these fields, the user is not created.

|Field | Description |
|---|---|
| data.email | Base64-encoded email address used to sign-in to the console UI. Must be unique. |
| data.username | Base64-encoded username displayed in the console UI. |
| data.password | Base64-encoded user password. There are no specific requirements regarding password strength, but it is recommended to use a password that is at least 8-characters-long. |

Create the Secrets in the cluster before Dex is installed. The Dex init-container with the tool that configures Dex generates user configuration data basing on properly labeled Secrets, and adds the data to the ConfigMap.

If you want to add a new static user after Dex is installed, restart the Dex Pod. This creates a new Pod with an updated ConfigMap.

## Bind a user to a Role or a ClusterRole

A newly created static user has no access to any resources of the cluster as there is no Role or ClusterRole bound to it.  
By default, Kyma comes with two ClusterRoles: **kyma-admin**, which allows to get full admin access to the entire cluster, and **kyma-view**, which allows to view and list all of the resources of the cluster.

To bind a newly created user to the **kyma-view** ClusterRole, run this command:
```
kubectl create clusterrolebinding {BINDING_NAME} --clusterrole=kyma-view --user={USER_EMAIL}
```

To check if the binding is created, run:
```
kubectl get clusterrolebinding {BINDING_NAME}
```
