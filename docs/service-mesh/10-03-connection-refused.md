Mutual TLS (mTLS) is enabled in the Service Mesh by default. As a result, every element of the Service Mesh must have an Istio sidecar with a valid TLS certificate to allow communication. Attempts to establish connection between a service with a sidecar and a service without a sidecar result in a `Connection reset by peer` or a `GOAWAY` response. 

- To enable sidecar injection for Pods of existing Services, restart them after upgrading to Kyma 1.0 or higher.
- To allow connections between a Service with a sidecar and Services without a sidecar, create an [Authentication Policy](https://istio.io/pt-br/docs/reference/config/security/istio.authentication.v1alpha1/) in the `PERMISSIVE` mode.
- To whitelist a Service without a sidecar and disable mTLS traffic for it, create a [DestinationRule](https://istio.io/docs/reference/config/networking/destination-rule/).

>**TIP:** You can use the [`istioctl authn tls-check`](https://istio.io/pt-br/docs/reference/commands/istioctl/#istioctl-authn-tls-check) command to find out where communication fails.
