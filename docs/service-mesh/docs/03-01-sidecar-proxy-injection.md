title: Sidecar Proxy Injection
type: Details
---

By default, the Istio Sidecar Injector watches all Pod creation operations on all Namespaces and it injects the newly created Pods with a sidecar proxy.

> **NOTE:** To disable the sidecar proxy injection, set the **istio-injection** label value to `disabled` for the Namespace in which you want to disable the sidecar proxy injection. Use this command: `kubectl label namespace {YOUR_NAMESPACE} istio-injection=disabled`
                                                                                                                                                                                  
With the sidecar proxy injection enabled, you can inject the sidecar to Pods of a selected deployment in the given Namespace. Add this annotation to the deployment configuration file:
```
sidecar.istio.io/inject: "true"
```
