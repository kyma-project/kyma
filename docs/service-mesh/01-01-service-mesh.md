Kyma Service Mesh is the component responsible for service-to-service communication, proxying, service discovery, traceability, and security. 
To deliver this functionality, Kyma Service Mesh uses [Istio](https://istio.io/docs/concepts/what-is-istio/) open platform. 

The main principle of Kyma Service Mesh is to inject Pods of every service with the Envoy sidecar proxy. Envoy intercepts the communication between the services and regulates it by applying and enforcing the rules you create. 
Kyma [Dex](https://github.com/dexidp/dex), which is also a part of the Service Mesh, allows you to integrate any [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/)-compliant identity provider or a SAML2-based enterprise authentication server with your solution.

By default, Istio in Kyma has [mutual TLS (mTLS)](https://istio.io/docs/tasks/security/mutual-tls/) enabled and injects a sidecar container to every Pod. You can manage mTLS traffic in services or at a Namespace level by creating [Destination Rules](https://istio.io/docs/reference/config/networking/v1alpha3/destination-rule/) and [Authentication Policies](https://istio.io/docs/reference/config/istio.authentication.v1alpha1/). If you disable sidecar injection in a service or in a Namespace, you must manage their traffic configuration by creating appropriate Destination Rules and Authentication Policies.

>**NOTE:** The Istio Control Plane doesn't have mTLS enabled.

See this [Istio diagram](https://istio.io/docs/concepts/what-is-istio/arch.svg) to understand the relationship between the Istio components and services.

Kyma uses [Kiali](https://www.kiali.io) to enable validation, observe Istio Service Mesh, and provide details on microservices included in the Service Mesh and connections between them. For Kiali chart configuration, see [this](#configuration-kiali-chart) document.

>**NOTE:** Kiali is disabled by default. Read [this](/root/kyma/#configuration-custom-component-installation) document for instructions on how to enable it.
