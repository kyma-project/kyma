title: Issues with Istio sidecar injection
type: Troubleshooting
---


Kyma has sidecar injection enabled by default - it injects sidecars to every Deployment on a cluster, without the need of labeling a Deployment or Namespace. For more information, read [this document](#details-sidecar-proxy-injection) or follow the [Istio documentation](https://istio.io/docs/ops/common-problems/injection/).
