type: Troubleshooting
---


Kyma has sidecar injection enabled by default - it injects sidecars to every deployment on cluster, without the need of labelling a deployment or namespace. For more information, read [this document](#details-sidecar-proxy-injection).
 
 
 If you still encounter any problems after the lecture, follow the Istio [official documentation](https://istio.io/docs/ops/common-problems/injection/).
