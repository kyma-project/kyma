The `clusterassetgroups.rafter.kyma-project.io` CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) is a detailed description of the kind of data and the format used to define an orchestrator that creates ClusterAsset CRs for a specific asset type. To get the up-to-date CRD and show the output in the YAML format, run this command:

```bash
kubectl get crd clusterassetgroups.rafter.kyma-project.io -o yaml
```

|----------|:-------------:|------|
| **metadata.name** | Yes | Specifies the name of the CR. It also defines the **rafter.kyma-project.io/asset-group** label added to the ClusterAsset CR that the ClusterAssetGroup CR defines. Because of label name limitations, ClusterAssetGroup CR names can have a maximum length of 63 characters. |
| **metadata.labels** | No | Specifies how to filter and group ClusterAsset CRs that the ClusterAssetGroup CR defines. See [this](#details-rafter-in-console) document for more details. |
| **spec.displayName** | Yes | Specifies a human-readable name of the ClusterAssetGroup CR. |
| **spec.description** | Yes | Provides more details on the purpose of the ClusterAssetGroup CR. |
| **spec.bucketRef.name** | No | Specifies the name of the bucket that stores the assets from the ClusterAssetGroup. |
| **spec.sources** | Yes  | Defines the type of the asset and the **rafter.kyma-project.io/type** label added to the ClusterAsset CR.  |
| **spec.sources.type** | Yes | Specifies the type of assets included in the ClusterAssetGroup CR. |
| **spec.sources.displayName** | No | Specifies a human-readable name of the asset. |
| **spec.sources.name** | Yes | Defines a unique identifier of a given asset. It must be unique if there is more than one asset of a given type in a ClusterAssetGroup CR. |
| **spec.sources.mode** | Yes | Specifies if the asset consists of one file or a set of compressed files in the ZIP or TAR format. Use `single` for one file and `package` for a set of files.  |
| **spec.sources.parameters** | No | Specifies a set of parameters for the ClusterAsset. For example, use it to define what to render, disable, or modify in the UI. Define it in a valid YAML or JSON format. |
| **spec.sources.url** | Yes  | Specifies the location of a single file or a package. |
| **spec.sources.filter** | No | Specifies a set of assets from the package to upload. The regex used in the filter must be [RE2](https://golang.org/s/re2syntax)-compliant. |
| **status.lastHeartbeatTime** | Not applicable | Specifies when was the last time when the ClusterAssetGroup Controller processed the ClusterAssetGroup CR. |
| **status.message** | Not applicable | Describes a human-readable message on the CR processing progress, success, or failure. |
| **status.phase** | Not applicable | The ClusterAssetGroup Controller adds it to the ClusterAssetGroup CR. It describes the status of processing the ClusterAssetGroup CR by the ClusterAssetGroup Controller. It can be `Ready`, `Pending`, or `Failed`. |
| **status.reason** | Not applicable | Provides the reason why the ClusterAssetGroup CR processing succeeded, is pending, or failed. See the [**Reasons**](#status-reasons) section for the full list of possible status reasons and their descriptions.  |

>**NOTE:** The ClusterAssetGroup Controller automatically adds all parameters marked as **Not applicable** to the ClusterAssetGroup CR.
