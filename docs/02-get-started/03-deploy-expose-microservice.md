title: Deploy and expose a microservice
---

You already know how to [deploy](02-deploy-expose-function.md#create-a-function) and [expose a Function](02-deploy-expose-function.md#expose-the-function). Let's now do the same with a container microservice.
We'll use the Kyma example [`orders-service`](https://github.com/kyma-project/examples/blob/master/orders-service/README.md) for this.

## Deploy the microservice

First, let's create a Deployment that provides the microservice definition and lets you run it on the cluster.

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Kyma Dashboard**

1. From the left navigation, go to **Workloads > Deployments**.
2. Click on **Create Deployment**.
3. Go to **Advanced** and provide the following parameters:
    - **Name**: `orders-service`
    - **Docker Image**: `eu.gcr.io/kyma-project/develop/orders-service:68a58069`  
  
    _Optionally_, to save resources, modify these parameters:
    - **Memory requests**: `10Mi`
    - **Memory limits**: `32Mi`
    - **CPU requests (m)**: `16m`
    - **CPU limits (m)**: `20m`  
  
4. Click **Create**.

The operation was successful if you can see `1/1` Pods running in the Deployment's view.

#### **kubectl**

Run:

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: orders-service
    namespace: default
    labels:
      app: orders-service
      example: orders-service
  spec:
    replicas: 1
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        app: orders-service
        example: orders-service
    template:
      metadata:
        labels:
          app: orders-service
          example: orders-service
      spec:
        containers:
          - name: orders-service
            image: "eu.gcr.io/kyma-project/develop/orders-service:e8175c63"
            imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
            resources:
              limits:
                cpu: 20m
                memory: 32Mi
              requests:
                cpu: 10m
                memory: 16Mi
            env:
              - name: APP_PORT
                value: "8080"
              - name: APP_REDIS_PREFIX
                value: "REDIS_"
EOF
```

To check that the Deployment was created successfully, run:
```bash
kubectl get deployment orders-service -o=jsonpath="{.status.readyReplicas}"
```

The operation was successful if the returned number of **readyReplicas** is `1`.

> **NOTE:** You might need to wait a few seconds for the replica to be ready and return the status.

<!-- tabs:end -->

### Create the Service

Now that we have the Deployment, let's deploy the [Kubernetes Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) to allow other Kubernetes resources to communicate with your microservice.

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Kyma Dashboard**

1. From the left navigation, go to **Discovery and Network > Services**.
2. Click on **Create Service**.
3. In the **Create Service** view, paste the following values to your YAML file:  

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: orders-service
   spec:
     selector:
       app: orders-service
     ports:
       - protocol: TCP
         port: 80
         targetPort: 8080
    ```

4. Click **Create**. 
  
#### **kubectl**

Run:

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Service
  metadata:
    name: orders-service
    namespace: default
    labels:
      app: orders-service
      example: orders-service
  spec:
    type: ClusterIP
    ports:
      - name: http
        port: 80
        protocol: TCP
        targetPort: 8080
    selector:
      app: orders-service
      example: orders-service
EOF
```

To check that the Service was created successfully, run:

```bash
kubectl get service orders-service -o=jsonpath="{.metadata.uid}"
```

The operation was successful if the command returns the **uid** of your Service.

<!-- tabs:end -->

## Expose the microservice

We have created the Service. Let's now expose it outside the cluster.

> **CAUTION:** Exposing a workload to the outside world is always a potential security vulnerability, so tread carefully. In a production environment, always secure the workload you expose with [OAuth2](https://kyma-project.io/#/api-gateway/user/tutorials/01-50-expose-and-secure-a-workload/01-50-expose-and-secure-workload-oauth2) or [JWT](https://kyma-project.io/#/api-gateway/user/tutorials/01-50-expose-and-secure-a-workload/01-52-expose-and-secure-workload-jwt).

To expose our microservice, we must create an [APIRule CR](https://kyma-project.io/#/api-gateway/user/custom-resources/apirule/04-10-apirule-custom-resource), just like when we [exposed our Function](02-deploy-expose-function.md#expose-the-function).

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Kyma Dashboard**

1. Go to **Discovery and Network** > **API Rules**, and click on **Create API Rule**.
2. Provide the **Name** (`orders-service`)
3. Choose `orders-service` from the **Service Name** dropdown.
4. Provide your Service **Port** (`80`).
5. Choose your host from the **Host** dropdown and replace the asterisk (*) with the name of your subdomain (`orders-service`).
6. Click **Create**.

#### **kubectl**

Run:

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: gateway.kyma-project.io/v1beta1
kind: APIRule
metadata:
  name: orders-service
  namespace: default
  labels:
    app: orders-service
    example: orders-service
spec:
  host: orders-service.$CLUSTER_DOMAIN
  service:
    name: orders-service
    port: 80
  gateway: kyma-system/kyma-gateway
  rules:
    - path: /.*
      methods: ["GET","POST"]
      accessStrategies:
        - handler: noop
      mutators: []
EOF
```
<!-- tabs:end -->

### Verify the microservice exposure

Now let's check that the microservice has been exposed successfully.

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Kyma Dashboard**

1. From your Service's view, get the APIRule's **Host**.

   > **NOTE:** Alternatively, from the left navigation go to **API Rules** and get the **Host** URL from there.

2. Paste this **Host** in your browser and add the `/orders` suffix to the end of it, like this: `{HOST}/orders`. Open it.

The operation was successful if the page shows the (possibly empty `[]`) list of orders.

#### **kubectl**

Run:

```bash
curl https://orders-service.$CLUSTER_DOMAIN/orders
```

The operation was successful if the command returns the (possibly empty `[]`) list of orders.

<!-- tabs:end -->
