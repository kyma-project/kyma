title: Expose multiple workloads on the same host
---

This tutorial shows how to expose multiple workloads on different paths by defining a service at the root level and by defining services on each path separately.

   > **CAUTION:** Exposing a workload to the outside world is always a potential security vulnerability, so tread carefully. In a production environment, remember to secure the workload you expose with [OAuth2](../apix-05-expose-and-secure-a-workload/apix-05-01-expose-and-secure-workload-oauth2.md) or [JWT](../apix-05-expose-and-secure-a-workload/apix-05-03-expose-and-secure-workload-jwt.md).

## Prerequisites

* Deploy [a sample HttpBin service and a sample Function](../apix-01-create-workload.md).
* Set up [your custom domain](../apix-02-setup-custom-domain-for-workload.md) or use a Kyma domain instead. 
* Depending on whether you use your custom domain or a Kyma domain, export the necessary values as environment variables:
  
  <div tabs name="export-values">

    <details>
    <summary>
    Custom domain
    </summary>
    
    ```bash
    export DOMAIN_TO_EXPOSE_WORKLOADS={DOMAIN_NAME}
    export GATEWAY=$NAMESPACE/httpbin-gateway
    ```
    </details>

    <details>
    <summary>
    Kyma domain
    </summary>

    ```bash
    export DOMAIN_TO_EXPOSE_WORKLOADS={KYMA_DOMAIN_NAME}
    export GATEWAY=kyma-system/kyma-gateway
    ```
    </details>
  </div>   

## Define multiple services on different paths

Follow the instructions to expose the instance of the HttpBin service and the sample Function on different paths at the `spec.rules` level without a root service defined.

1. To expose the instance of the HttpBin service and the instance of the sample Function, create an API Rule CR in your Namespace. Run:

   ```bash
   cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
   apiVersion: gateway.kyma-project.io/v1beta1
   kind: APIRule
   metadata:
     name: multiple-service
     namespace: $NAMESPACE
     labels:
       app: multiple-service
       example: multiple-service
   spec:
     host: multiple-service-example.$DOMAIN_TO_EXPOSE_WORKLOADS
     gateway: $GATEWAY
     rules:
       - path: /headers
         methods: ["GET"]
         accessStrategies:
           - handler: noop
         service:
           name: httpbin
           port: 8000
       - path: /function
         methods: ["GET"]
         accessStrategies:
           - handler: noop
         service:
           name: function
           port: 80
   EOF
   ```

2. To call the endpoints, send `GET` requests to the HttpBin service and the sample Function:

    ```bash
    curl -ik -X GET https://multiple-service-example.$DOMAIN_TO_EXPOSE_WORKLOADS/headers

    curl -ik -X GET https://multiple-service-example.$DOMAIN_TO_EXPOSE_WORKLOADS/function 
    ```
  If successful, the calls return the code `200 OK` response.

## Define a service at the root level

A service can be also defined at the root level. Such a definition is applied to all the paths specified at the `spec.rules` which do not have their own services defined. 
 
 > **NOTE:** Services definitions at the `spec.rules` level have precedence over service definition at the `spec.service` level.

Follow the instructions to expose the instance of the HttpBin service and the sample Function on different paths with a service defined at the root level.

1. To expose the instance of the HttpBin service and the instance of the sample Function, create an API Rule CR in your Namespace. Run:

   ```bash
   cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
   apiVersion: gateway.kyma-project.io/v1beta1
   kind: APIRule
   metadata:
     name: multiple-service
     namespace: $NAMESPACE
     labels:
       app: multiple-service
       example: multiple-service
   spec:
     host: multiple-service-example.$DOMAIN_TO_EXPOSE_WORKLOADS
     gateway: $GATEWAY
     service:
       name: httpbin
       port: 8000
     rules:
       - path: /headers
         methods: ["GET"]
         accessStrategies:
           - handler: noop
       - path: /function
         methods: ["GET"]
         accessStrategies:
           - handler: noop
         service:
           name: function
           port: 80
   EOF
   ```
  In the above APIRule, the HttpBin service on port 8000 is defined at the `spec.service` level. This service definition is applied to the `/headers` path. The `/function` path has the service definition overwritten.

2. To call the endpoints, send `GET` requests to the HttpBin service and the sample Function:

    ```bash
    curl -ik -X GET https://multiple-service-example.$DOMAIN_TO_EXPOSE_WORKLOADS/headers

    curl -ik -X GET https://multiple-service-example.$DOMAIN_TO_EXPOSE_WORKLOADS/function 
    ```
  If successful, the calls return the code `200 OK` response.
