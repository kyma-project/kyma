title: Expose and secure a workload with OAuth2
---

This tutorial shows how to expose and secure services or Functions using API Gateway Controller. The controller reacts to an instance of the API Rule custom resource (CR) and creates an Istio Virtual Service and [Oathkeeper Access Rules](https://www.ory.sh/docs/oathkeeper/api-access-rules) according to the details specified in the CR. To interact with the secured services, the tutorial uses an OAuth2 client registered through the Hydra Maester controller.

You can use it as a follow-up to the [Use a custom domain to expose a workload](./apix-01-own-domain.md) tutorial.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial is based on a sample HttpBin service deployment and a sample Function. To deploy or create one of those, follow the [Create a workload](./apix-02-create-workload.md) tutorial.

## Register an OAuth2 client and get tokens

1. Export your client as an environment variable:

   ```shell
   export CLIENT_NAME={YOUR_CLIENT_NAME}
   ```

2. Create an OAuth2 client with "read" and "write" scopes. Run:

   ```shell
   cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
   apiVersion: hydra.ory.sh/v1alpha1
   kind: OAuth2Client
   metadata:
     name: $CLIENT_NAME
     namespace: $NAMESPACE
   spec:
     grantTypes:
       - "client_credentials"
     scope: "read write"
     secretName: $CLIENT_NAME
   EOF
   ```

3. Export the credentials of the created client as environment variables. Run:

   ```shell
   export CLIENT_ID="$(kubectl get secret -n $NAMESPACE $CLIENT_NAME -o jsonpath='{.data.client_id}' | base64 --decode)"
   export CLIENT_SECRET="$(kubectl get secret -n $NAMESPACE $CLIENT_NAME -o jsonpath='{.data.client_secret}' | base64 --decode)"
   ```

4. Encode your client credentials and export them as an environment variable:

   ```shell
   export ENCODED_CREDENTIALS=$(echo -n "$CLIENT_ID:$CLIENT_SECRET" | base64)
   ```

5. Get tokens to interact with secured resources using client credentials flow:

   <div tabs>
     <details>
     <summary>
     Token with "read" scope
     </summary>

     1. Export the following value as an environment variable:

        ```shell
        export KYMA_DOMAIN={KYMA_DOMAIN_NAME}
        ```  

     2. Get the token:

         ```shell
         curl -ik -X POST "https://oauth2.$KYMA_DOMAIN/oauth2/token" -H "Authorization: Basic $ENCODED_CREDENTIALS" -F "grant_type=client_credentials" -F "scope=read"
         ```

     3. Export the issued token as an environment variable:

         ```shell
         export ACCESS_TOKEN_READ={ISSUED_READ_TOKEN}
         ```

     </details>
     <details>
     <summary>
     Token with "write" scope
     </summary>

     1. Export the following value as an environment variable:

        ```shell
        export KYMA_DOMAIN={KYMA_DOMAIN_NAME}
        ```  

     2. Get the token:

         ```shell
         curl -ik -X POST "https://oauth2.$KYMA_DOMAIN/oauth2/token" -H "Authorization: Basic $ENCODED_CREDENTIALS" -F "grant_type=client_credentials" -F "scope=write"
         ```

     3. Export the issued token as an environment variable:

         ```shell
         export ACCESS_TOKEN_WRITE={ISSUED_WRITE_TOKEN}
         ```

      </details>
   </div>

## Expose and secure your workload

Follow the instructions in the tabs to expose an instance of the HttpBin service or a sample Function, and secure them with Oauth2 scopes.

<div tabs>

  <details>
  <summary>
  HttpBin
  </summary>

1. Export the following value as an environment variable:

   ```bash
   export DOMAIN_TO_EXPOSE_WORKLOADS={DOMAIN_NAME} #This is a Kyma domain or your custom subdomain e.g. api.mydomain.com.
   ```

2. Expose the service and secure it by creating an API Rule CR in your Namespace. If you don't want to use your custom domain but a Kyma domain, use the following Kyma Gateway: `kyma-system/kyma-gateway`. Run:

   ```shell
   cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
   apiVersion: gateway.kyma-project.io/v1alpha1
   kind: APIRule
   metadata:
     name: httpbin
     namespace: $NAMESPACE
   spec:
     gateway: namespace-name/httpbin-gateway #The value corresponds to the Gateway CR you created. 
     service:
       name: httpbin
       port: 8000
       host: httpbin.$DOMAIN_TO_EXPOSE_WORKLOADS
     rules:
       - path: /.*
         methods: ["GET"]
         accessStrategies:
           - handler: oauth2_introspection
             config:
               required_scope: ["read"]
       - path: /post
         methods: ["POST"]
         accessStrategies:
           - handler: oauth2_introspection
             config:
               required_scope: ["write"]
   EOF
   ```

   >**NOTE:** If you are running Kyma on k3d, add `httpbin.kyma.local` to the entry with k3d IP in your system's `/etc/hosts` file.

   The exposed service requires tokens with "read" scope for `GET` requests in the entire service, and tokens with "write" scope for `POST` requests to the `/post` endpoint of the service.

  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>
  Function
  </summary>

1. Export the following value as an environment variable:

   ```bash
   export DOMAIN_TO_EXPOSE_WORKLOADS={DOMAIN_NAME} #This is a Kyma domain or your custom subdomain e.g. api.mydomain.com.
   ```

2. Expose the Function and secure it by creating an API Rule CR in your Namespace. If you don't want to use your custom domain but a Kyma domain, use the following Kyma Gateway: `kyma-system/kyma-gateway`. Run:

   ```shell
   cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
   apiVersion: gateway.kyma-project.io/v1alpha1
   kind: APIRule
   metadata:
     name: function
     namespace: $NAMESPACE
   spec:
     gateway: namespace-name/httpbin-gateway #The value corresponds to the Gateway CR you created. 
     service:
       name: function
       port: 80
       host: function-example.$DOMAIN_TO_EXPOSE_WORKLOADS
     rules:
       - path: /function
         methods: ["GET"]
         accessStrategies:
           - handler: oauth2_introspection
             config:
               required_scope: ["read"]
   EOF
   ```

   >**NOTE:** If you are running Kyma on k3d, add `httpbin.kyma.local` to the entry with k3d IP in your system's `/etc/hosts` file.

   The exposed Function requires all `GET` requests to have a valid token with the "read" scope.

>**CAUTION:** When you secure a workload, don't create overlapping Access Rules for paths. Doing so can cause unexpected behavior and reduce the security of your implementation.

## Access the secured resources

Follow the instructions in the tabs to call the secured service or Functions using the tokens issued for the client you registered.

<div tabs>

  <details>
  <summary>
  Call secured endpoints of a service
  </summary>

1. Send a `GET` request with a token that has the "read" scope to the HttpBin service:

   ```shell
   curl -ik -X GET https://httpbin.$DOMAIN_TO_EXPOSE_WORKLOADS/headers -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN_READ"
   ```

2. Send a `POST` request with a token that has the "write" scope to the HttpBin's `/post` endpoint:

   ```shell
   curl -ik -X POST https://httpbin.$DOMAIN_TO_EXPOSE_WORKLOADS/post -d "test data" -H "Authorization: bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN_WRITE"
   ```

These calls return the code `200` response. If you call the service without a token, you get the code `401` response. If you call the service or its secured endpoint with a token with the wrong scope, you get the code `403` response.

  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>
  Call the secured Function
  </summary>

Send a `GET` request with a token that has the "read" scope to the Function:

   ```shell
   curl -ik https://function-example.$DOMAIN_TO_EXPOSE_WORKLOADS/function -H "Authorization: bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN_READ"
   ```

This call returns the code `200` response. If you call the Function without a token, you get the code `401` response. If you call the Function with a token with the wrong scope, you get the code `403` response.

  </details>
</div>
