title: Expose a workload
---

This tutorial shows how to expose service endpoints and configure different allowed HTTP methods for them using API Gateway Controller.

The tutorial may be a follow-up to the [Use a custom domain to expose a workload](./apix-01-own-domain.md) tutorial.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial is based on a sample HttpBin service deployment and a sample Function. To deploy or create one of those, follow the [Create a workload](./apix-02-create-workload.md) tutorial.

## Expose and access your workload

Follow the instruction to expose and access your unsecured instance of the HttpBin service or unsecured sample Function.

1. Export the following value as an environment variable:

   ```bash
   export DOMAIN_TO_EXPOSE_WORKLOADS={DOMAIN_NAME} #This is a Kyma domain or your custom subdomain e.g. api.mydomain.com.
   ```

2. Expose the instance of the HttpBin service by creating an API Rule CR in your Namespace. If you don't want to use your custom domain but a Kyma domain, use the following Kyma Gateway: `kyma-system/kyma-gateway`. Run:

   ```bash
   cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
   apiVersion: gateway.kyma-project.io/v1alpha1
   kind: APIRule
   metadata:
     name: httpbin
     namespace: $NAMESPACE
   spec:
     service:
       host: httpbin.$DOMAIN_TO_EXPOSE_WORKLOADS
       name: httpbin
       port: 8000
     gateway: $NAMESPACE/httpbin-gateway #The value corresponds to the Gateway CR you created.
     rules:
       - path: /.*
         methods: ["GET"]
         accessStrategies:
           - handler: noop
         mutators:
           - handler: noop
       - path: /post
         methods: ["POST"]
         accessStrategies:
           - handler: noop
         mutators:
           - handler: noop
   EOF
   ```

   >**NOTE:** If you are running Kyma on k3d, add `httpbin.kyma.local` to the entry with k3d IP in your system's `/etc/hosts` file.

3. Call the endpoint by sending a `GET` request to the HttpBin service:

   ```bash
   curl -ik -X GET https://httpbin.$DOMAIN_TO_EXPOSE_WORKLOADS/ip
   ```

4. Send a `POST` request to the HttpBin's `/post` endpoint:

   ```bash
   curl -ik -X POST https://httpbin.$DOMAIN_TO_EXPOSE_WORKLOADS/post -d "test data"
   ```

   These calls return the code `200` response.

  Function
  </summary>

1. Export the following value as an environment variable:

   ```bash
   export DOMAIN_TO_EXPOSE_WORKLOADS={DOMAIN_NAME} #This is a Kyma domain or your custom subdomain e.g. api.mydomain.com.
   ```

2. Expose the sample Function by creating an API Rule CR in your Namespace. If you don't want to use your custom domain but a Kyma domain, use the following Kyma Gateway: `kyma-system/kyma-gateway`. Run:

   ```shell
   cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
   apiVersion: gateway.kyma-project.io/v1alpha1
   kind: APIRule
   metadata:
     name: function
     namespace: $NAMESPACE
   spec:
     gateway: namespace-name/httpbin-gateway #The value corresponds to the Gateway CR you created. 
     service:
       name: function
       port: 80
       host: function-example.$DOMAIN_TO_EXPOSE_WORKLOADS
     rules:
       - path: /function
         methods: ["GET"]
         accessStrategies:
           - handler: noop
   EOF
   ```

   >**NOTE:** If you are running Kyma on k3d, add `httpbin.kyma.local` to the entry with k3d IP in your system's `/etc/hosts` file.

3. Send a `GET` request to the Function:

   ```shell
   curl -ik https://function-example.$DOMAIN_TO_EXPOSE_WORKLOADS/function
   ```

   This call returns the code `200` response.
