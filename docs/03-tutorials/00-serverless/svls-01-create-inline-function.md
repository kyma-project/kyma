title: Create an inline Function
---

This tutorial shows how you can create a simple "Hello World" Function in Node.js. The Function's code and dependencies are defined as an inline code in the Function's **spec**.

>**TIP:** Serverless also allows you to store the Function's code and dependencies as sources in a Git repository. To learn more, read how to [Create a Git Function](./svls-02-create-git-function.md).

>**TIP:** Read about [Function’s specification](../../05-technical-reference/svls-07-function-specification.md) if you are interested in its signature, `event` and `context` objects, and custom HTTP responses the Function returns.

>**NOTE:** Read about [Istio sidecars in Kyma and why you want them](../../01-overview/service-mesh/smsh-03-istio-sidecars-in-kyma.md). Then, check how to [enable automatic Istio sidecar proxy injection](../../04-operation-guides/operations/smsh-01-istio-enable-sidecar-injection.md). For more details, see [Default Istio setup in Kyma](../../01-overview/service-mesh/smsh-02-default-istio-setup-in-kyma.md).

## Steps

Follow these steps:

  <details>
  <summary label="cli">
  Kyma CLI
  </summary>

1.  Export these variables:

    ```bash
    export NAME={FUNCTION_NAME}
    export NAMESPACE={FUNCTION_NAMESPACE}
    ```

2.  Create your local development workspace.

    a. Create a new folder to keep the Function's code and configuration in one place:

    ```bash
    mkdir {FOLDER_NAME}
    cd {FOLDER_NAME}
    ```

    b. Create initial scaffolding for the Function using the dedicated CLI command:

    ```bash
    kyma init function --name $NAME --namespace $NAMESPACE
    ```

3.  Code and configure.

    Open the workspace in your favorite IDE. If you have Visual Studio Code installed, run the following command from the terminal in your workspace folder:

    ```bash
    code .
    ```

    It's time to inspect the code and the `config.yaml` file. Feel free to adjust the "Hello World" sample code.

4.  Deploy and verify.

    a. Call the `apply` command from the workspace folder. It will build the container and run it on the Kyma runtime pointed by your current KUBECONFIG file:

      ```bash
      kyma apply function
      ```

    b. Check if your Function was created successfully:

      ```bash
      kubectl get functions $NAME -n $NAMESPACE
      ```

    You should get a result similar to this example:

    ```bash
    NAME            CONFIGURED   BUILT     RUNNING   RUNTIME    VERSION   AGE
    test-function   True         True      True      nodejs18   1         96s
    ```

  </summary>

1.  Export these variables:

    ```bash
    export NAME={FUNCTION_NAME}
    export NAMESPACE={FUNCTION_NAMESPACE}
    ```

2.  Create a Function CR that specifies the Function's logic:

   ```yaml
   cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
   apiVersion: serverless.kyma-project.io/v1alpha2
   kind: Function
   metadata:
     name: $NAME
     namespace: $NAMESPACE
   spec:
     runtime: nodejs18
     source:
       inline:
         source: |
           module.exports = {
             main: function(event, context) {
               return 'Hello World!'
             }
           }
   EOF
   ```

3.  Check if your Function was created successfully and all conditions are set to `True`:

    ```bash
    kubectl get functions $NAME -n $NAMESPACE
    ```

    You should get a result similar to this example:

    ```bash
    NAME            CONFIGURED   BUILT     RUNNING   RUNTIME    VERSION   AGE
    test-function   True         True      True      nodejs18   1         96s
    ```

    Kyma Dashboard
    </summary>

>**NOTE:** Kyma Dashboard uses Busola, which is not installed by default. Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/kyma-project/busola#installation) to install it.

1.  Create a Namespace or select one from the drop-down list in the top navigation panel.

2.  Go to **Workloads** > **Functions** and select **Create Function**.

3.  In the dialog box, provide the Function's name or click on **Generate**. 
>**NOTE:** The **Node.js Function** preset is selected by default. It means that the selected runtime is `Node.js`, and the **Source** code is autogenerated. You can choose the Python runtime by clicking on the **Choose preset** button.

```js
module.exports = {
  main: async function (event, context) {
    const message =
      `Hello World` +
      ` from the Kyma Function ${context['function-name']}` +
      ` running on ${context.runtime}!`;
    console.log(message);
    return message;
  },
};
```

    The dialog box closes. Wait for the **Status** field to change into `RUNNING`, confirming that the Function was created successfully.

   If you decide to modify it, click **Edit** and confirm changes afterward by selecting the **Update** button.

    You will see the message at the bottom of the screen confirming the Function was updated.
