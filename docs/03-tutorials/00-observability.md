If you're interested in learning more about the Telemetry module and how to integrate backends, check out these links:

- Install the [OpenTelemetry Demo App](https://github.com/kyma-project/examples/tree/main/trace-demo) and see it in action to learn more about distributed tracing.

- Push application logs to a [custom Loki stack](https://github.com/kyma-project/examples/tree/main/loki).

- Push traces based on OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) to a [custom Jaeger stack](https://github.com/kyma-project/examples/tree/main/jaeger).

- Push metrics based on OTLP to any [OTLP based metric backend](https://github.com/kyma-project/examples/tree/main/metrics-otlp).

For a tutorial based on a typical prometheus stack, please read [Monitoring in Kyma using a custom kube-prometheus-stack](https://github.com/kyma-project/examples/edit/main/prometheus/README.md)
