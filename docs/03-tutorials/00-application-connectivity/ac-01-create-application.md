title: Create a new Application
---

>**NOTE:** An Application represents a single connected external solution.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, export the name of your application as an environment variable:

```bash
export APP_NAME={YOUR_APP_NAME}
```

>**NOTE:** Read about [Istio sidecars in Kyma and why you want them](../../01-overview/main-areas/service-mesh/smsh-03-istio-sidecars-in-kyma.md). Then, check how to [enable automatic Istio sidecar proxy injection](../../04-operation-guides/operations/smsh-01-istio-enable-sidecar-injection.md). For more details, see [Default Istio setup in Kyma](../../01-overview/main-areas/service-mesh/smsh-02-default-istio-setup-in-kyma.md).

## Create an Application

To create a new Application, run this command:

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: applicationconnector.kyma-project.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: $APP_NAME
spec:
  description: Application description
  labels:
    region: us
    kind: production
EOF
```

## Get the Application data

To get the data of the created Application and show the output in the `yaml` format, run this command:
```bash
kubectl get app $APP_NAME -o yaml
```

A successful response returns the Application custom resource with the specified name. 
This is an example response:

```yaml
apiVersion: applicationconnector.kyma-project.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  clusterName: ""
  creationTimestamp: 2018-11-22T13:53:20Z
  generation: 1
  name: test1
  namespace: ""
  resourceVersion: "30728"
  selfLink: /apis/applicationconnector.kyma-project.io/v1alpha1/applications/test1
  uid: f8ca5595-ee5d-11e8-acb2-000d3a443243
spec:
  description: {APP_DESCRIPTION}
  labels:
    kind: "production"
    region: "us"
```

If there are registered services connected to your Application in Kyma, the response also shows them: 

```yaml
...
spec:
  description: {APP_DESCRIPTION}
  labels:
    kind: "production"
    region: "us"
  services: {LIST_OF_REGISTERED_SERVICES}
```
**TIP:** You can use Kyma Dashboard to create and manage your Application. To do so, go to **Integration > Applications** from the **Cluster Details** view.
