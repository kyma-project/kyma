title: Install Kyma locally
type: Installation
---

This Installation guide shows you how to quickly deploy Kyma locally on the MacOS, Linux, and Windows platforms. Kyma is installed locally using a proprietary installer based on a [Kubernetes operator](https://coreos.com/operators/).

>**TIP:** See [this](#troubleshooting-overview) document for troubleshooting tips.

## Prerequisites

- [Kyma CLI](https://github.com/kyma-project/cli)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) 1.0
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) 1.12
- [Helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm) 2.10

Virtualization:

- [Hyperkit driver](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/reference/drivers/hyperkit/) - MacOS only
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) - Linux only

> **NOTE**: To work with Kyma, use only the provided commands. Kyma requires a specific Minikube configuration and does not work on a basic Minikube cluster that you can start using the `minikube start` command.


## Install Kyma

Follow these instructions to install Kyma from a release or from sources:

  1. Provision a Kubernetes cluster on Minikube. Run:

     ```bash
     kyma provision minikube
     ```
     >**NOTE:** The `provision` command uses the default Minikube VM driver installed for your operating system. For a list of supported VM drivers see [this document](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/minikube/#quickstart).

  2. Install the latest Kyma release on Minikube:
     ```bash
     kyma install
     ```
     >**NOTE** If you want to install a specific release version, go to the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/releases) to find out more about available releases. Use the release version as a parameter when calling ` kyma install --release {KYMA_RELEASE}`.

  1. Open a terminal window and navigate to a space in which you want to store local Kyma sources.

  2. Clone the `Kyma` repository using HTTPS. Run:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma.git
     ```
  3. Provision a Kubernetes cluster on Minikube. Run:
     ```bash
     kyma provision minikube
     ```
     >**NOTE:** The `provision` command uses default Minikube VM driver installed for your OS. For a list of supported VM drivers see [this document](http://github.com/kyma-project/cli).

  4. Install Kyma from sources. Run:

     ```bash
     kyma install --local --src-path {YOUR_KYMA_SOURCE_PATH}
     ```

## Post-installation steps

Kyma comes with a local wildcard self-signed `server.crt` certificate. The `kyma install` command downloads and adds this certificate to the trusted certificates in your OS so you can access the Console UI.

>**NOTE:** Mozilla Firefox uses its own certificate keychain. If you want to access the Console UI though Firefox, add the Kyma wildcard certificate to the certificate keychain of the browser. To access the Application Connector and connect an external solution to the local deployment of Kyma, you must add the certificate to the trusted certificate storage of your programming environment. Read [this](/components/application-connector#details-access-the-application-connector-on-a-local-kyma-deployment) document to learn more.

1. After the installation is completed, you can access the Console UI. Go to [this](https://console.kyma.local) address and select **Login with Email**. Use the **admin@kyma.cx** email address and the password printed in the terminal once the installation process is completed.

2. At this point, Kyma is ready for you to explore. See what you can achieve using the Console UI or check out one of the [available examples](https://github.com/kyma-project/examples).

Read [this](#installation-reinstall-kyma) document to learn how to reinstall Kyma without deleting the cluster from Minikube.

## Stop and restart Kyma without reinstalling

Use the Kyma CLI to restart the Minikube cluster without reinstalling Kyma. Follow these steps to stop and restart your cluster:

1. Stop the Minikube cluster with Kyma installed. Run:
   ```
   minikube stop
   ```
2. Restart the cluster without reinstalling Kyma. Run:
   ```bash
   kyma provision minikube
   ```

The Kyma CLI discovers that a Minikube cluster is initialized and asks if you want to delete it. Answering `no` causes the Kyma CLI to start the Minikube cluster and restarts all of the previously installed components. Even though this procedure takes some time, it is faster than a clean installation as you don't download all of the required Docker images.

To verify that the restart is successful, run this command and check if all Pods have the `RUNNING` status:

```
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
```
