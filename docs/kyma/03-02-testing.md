Kyma components use [Octopus](http://github.com/kyma-incubator/octopus) for testing.
Octopus is a testing framework that allows you to run tests defined as Docker images on a running cluster.
Octopus uses two CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs):
- TestDefinition, which defines your test as a Pod specification.
- ClusterTestSuite, which defines a suite of tests to execute and how to execute them.

## Add a new test
To add a new test, create a `yaml` file with TestDefinition CR in your chart. To comply with the convention, place it under the `tests` directory.
See the exemplary chart structure for Dex:

```
# Chart tree
dex
├── Chart.yaml
├── README.md
├── templates
│   ├── tests
│   │   └── test-dex-connection.yaml
│   ├── dex-deployment.yaml
│   ├── dex-ingress.yaml
│   ├── dex-rbac-role.yaml
│   ├── dex-service.yaml
│   ├── pre-install-dex-account.yaml
│   ├── pre-install-dex-config-map.yaml
│   └── pre-install-dex-secrets.yaml
└── values.yaml
```

The test adds a new **test-dex-connection.yaml** under the `templates/tests` directory.
For more information on TestDefinition, read the [Octopus documentation](https://github.com/kyma-incubator/octopus/blob/master/docs/crd-test-definition.md).

The following example presents TestDefinition with a container that calls the Dex endpoint with cURL. You must define at least the **spec.template** parameter which is of the `PodTemplateSpec` type.

```yaml
apiVersion: "testing.kyma-project.io/v1alpha1"
kind: TestDefinition
metadata:
  name: "test-{{ template "fullname" . }}-connection-dex"
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        sidecar.istio.io/inject: "false"
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: "test-{{ template "fullname" . }}-connection-dex"
        image: tutum/curl:alpine
        command: ["/usr/bin/curl"]
        args: [
          "--fail",
          "--max-time", "10",
          "--retry", "60",
          "--retry-delay", "3",
          "http://dex-service.{{ .Release.Namespace }}.svc.cluster.local:5556/.well-known/openid-configuration"
        ]
      restartPolicy: Never

```

## Tests execution
To run all tests, use the `testing.sh` script located in the `/installation/scripts/` directory.
Internally, the ClusterTestSuite resource is defined. It fetches all TestDefinitions and executes them.


### Run tests manually
To run tests manually, create your own ClusterTestSuite resource. See the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: testing.kyma-project.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterTestSuite
metadata:
  labels:
    controller-tools.k8s.io: "1.0"
  name: {my-suite}
spec:
  maxRetries: 0
  concurrency: 1
  count: 1
```

Creation of the suite triggers tests execution. See the current tests progress in the ClusterTestSuite status. Run:
```bash
 kubectl get cts {my-suite} -oyaml
 ```

The sample output looks as follows:
```
apiVersion: testing.kyma-project.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterTestSuite
metadata:
  name: {my-suite}
spec:
  concurrency: 1
  count: 1
  maxRetries: 0
status:
  conditions:
  - status: "True"
    type: Running
  results:
  - executions:
    - completionTime: 2019-04-05T12:23:00Z
      id: {my-suite}-test-dex-dex-connection-dex-0
      podPhase: Succeeded
      startTime: 2019-04-05T12:22:54Z
    name: test-dex-dex-connection-dex
    namespace: kyma-system
    status: Succeeded
  - executions:
    - id: {my-suite}-test-core-core-ui-acceptance-0
      podPhase: Running
      startTime: 2019-04-05T12:37:53Z
    name: test-core-core-ui-acceptance
    namespace: kyma-system
    status: Running
  - executions: []
    name: test-core-api-controller-0
    namespace: kyma-system
    status: NotYetScheduled
  startTime: 2019-04-05T12:22:53Z
```

The ID of the test execution is the same as the ID of the testing Pod. The testing Pod is created in the same Namespace as its TestDefinition. To get logs for a specific test, run the following command:
```
kubectl logs {execution-id} -n {test-def-namespace}
```
