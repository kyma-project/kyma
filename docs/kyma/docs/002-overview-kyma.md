One might ask what makes Kyma so special since it consists in 90% of open-source, cloud-native projects available to everyone, such as Istio, NATS, Kubeless, and Prometheus. Its uniqueness lies in the "glue" that holds these components together. Kyma collects those cutting-edge solutions in one place and combines them with the 10% of in-house developed features that allow you to create application extensions, and connect services easily and intuitively.

Kyma allows you to extend and customize the functionality of your products in a quick and modern way, using serverless computing and microservice architecture. The extensions and customizations you create are decoupled from the core applications, which means that:
- Deployments are quick.
- Scaling is independent from the core applications.
- The changes you make can be easily reverted without causing downtime of the production system.

Last but not least, Kyma is highly cost-efficient. All Kyma native components and the connected open-source tools are written in Go. It ensures low memory consumption and reduced maintenance costs compared to applications written in other programming languages such as Java.
