title: Reinstall Kyma
type: Details
---

The custom scripts allow you to remove Kyma from a Minikube cluster and reinstall Kyma without removing the cluster.

> **NOTE:** These scripts do not delete the cluster from your Minikube. This allows you to quickly reinstall Kyma.

1. Use the `clean-up.sh` script to uninstall Kyma from the cluster. Run:
  ```
  scripts/clean-up.sh
  ```

2. Run this script to reinstall Kyma on an existing cluster:
  ```
  cmd/run.sh --skip-minikube-start
  ```
