type: Examples
---

The table contains a list of examples that demonstrate Kyma functionalities. You can run all of them locally or on a cluster. Examples are organized by a feature or concept they showcase. Each of them contains ready-to-use code snippets and the instructions in `README.md` documents.

Follow the links to examples' code and content sources, and try them on your own.
