title: Update Kyma
type: Installation
---

This guide describes how to update Kyma deployed locally or on a cluster.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- Access to a Docker Registry - only for cluster installation

## Overview

Kyma consists of multiple components, installed as [Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm/tree/master/docs) releases.

Update of an existing deployment can include:
- changes in charts
- changes in overrides
- adding new releases

The update procedure consists of three main steps:
- Prepare the update
- Update the Kyma Installer
- Trigger the update process

> **NOTE:** In case of dependency conflicts or major changes between components versions, some updates may not be possible.

> **NOTE:** Currently Kyma doesn't support removing components as a part of the update process.


## Prepare the update

- If you update an existing component, make all required changes to the Helm charts of the component located in the [`resource`](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/tree/master/resources) directory.


- If you add a new component to your Kyma deployment, add a top-level Helm chart for that component. Additionally, run this command to edit the Installation custom resource and add the new component to the installed components list:
  ```
  kubectl edit installation kyma-installation
  ```

  > **NOTE:** Read [this](#custom-resource-installation) document to learn more about the Installation custom resource.
     
     
- If you introduced changes in overrides, update the existing ConfigMaps and Secrets. Add new ConfigMaps and Secrets if required. See [this](#getting-started-helm-overrides-for-kyma-installation) document for more information on overrides.


## Update the Kyma Installer on a local deployment

- Build a new image for the Kyma Installer:  
  ```
  ./installation/scripts/build-kyma-installer.sh
  ```  
  > **NOTE:** If you started Kyma with the `run.sh` script with a `--vm-driver {value}` parameter, provide the same parameter to the `build-kyma-installer.sh` script.

- Restart the Kyma-Installer Pod:  
  ```
  kubectl delete pod -n kyma-installer {INSTALLER_POD_NAME}
  ```

## Update the Kyma Installer on a cluster deployment

- Build a new image for the Kyma Installer: 
  ```
  docker build -t {IMAGE_NAME}:{IMAGE_TAG} -f tools/kyma-installer/kyma.Dockerfile .
  ```

- Push the image to your Docker registry.

- Redeploy the Kyma Installer Pod using the new image. Run this command to edit the Deployment configuration:
  ```
  kubectl edit deployment kyma-installer -n kyma-installer
  ```
  Change the `image` and `imagePullPolicy` attributes in this section:  
    ```  
         spec:
           containers:
           - image: <your_image_name>:<your_tag>
             imagePullPolicy: Always
    ```  
  > **NOTE:** If the desired image name and `imagePullPolicy` is already set in the deployment configuration, restart  the Pod by running `kubectl delete pod -n kyma-installer {INSTALLER_POD_NAME}`

## Trigger the update process

Execute the following command to trigger the update process:

```
kubectl label installation/kyma-installation action=install
```
