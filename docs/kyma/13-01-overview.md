The troubleshooting section aims to identify the most common recurring problems the users face when they install and start using Kyma, as well as the most suitable solutions to these problems.
Each of the identified problems is described in a separate document. 
If you don't find a solution, don't hesitate to create a [GitHub](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/issues) issue or reach out to either the ["installation"](https://kyma-community.slack.com/messages/CD2HJ0E78) or ["general"](https://kyma-community.slack.com/messages/CBLBESMST) Slack channel to get direct support from the community.
