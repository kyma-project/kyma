You can use Helm to manage Kubernetes resources in Kyma, for example to check the already installed Kyma charts or to install new charts that are not included in the Kyma Installer image.

## Helm v3

As of version 1.14, Kyma uses [Helm v3](https://helm.sh/) to install and maintain components. Unlike its predecessor, Helm v3 interacts directly with the Kubernetes API and thus no longer features an in-cluster server. With Tiller gone, managing Kubernetes resources using Helm v3 CLI requires no manual configuration.
