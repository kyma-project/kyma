Kiali was deprecated with Kyma 2.8 and has been removed with Kyma 2.11. After upgrading to Kyma 2.11, run the script [2.10-2.11-cleanup-kiali.sh](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/blob/main/docs/assets/2.10-2.11-cleanup-kiali.sh) to remove Kiali. 
> **NOTE** Users who want to continue using Kiali should deploy the [Kiali example](https://github.com/kyma-project/examples/tree/main/kiali).
