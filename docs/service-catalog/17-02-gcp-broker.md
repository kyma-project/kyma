The GCP Service Broker is an open-source, [Open Service Broker](https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org/)-compatible API server that provisions managed services in the Google Cloud Platform public cloud. Kyma provides Namespace-scoped GCP Service Broker. In each Namespace, you can configure the GCP Service Broker against different subscriptions. Install the GCP Service Broker by provisioning the **GCP Service Broker** class provided by the Helm Broker.
