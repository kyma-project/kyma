The Microsoft Azure Service Broker is an open-source, [Open Service Broker](https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org/)-compatible API server that provisions managed services in the Microsoft Azure public cloud. Kyma provides Namespace-scoped Azure Service Broker. In each Namespace, you can configure the Azure Service Broker against different subscriptions. Install the Azure Service Broker by provisioning the **Azure Service Broker** class provided by the Helm Broker.
