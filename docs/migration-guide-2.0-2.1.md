title: Migration Guide 2.0-2.1
---

Due to an upgrade of the monitoring stack, some obsolete resources must be deleted and some must be patched.
When you upgrade from Kyma 2.0 to 2.1, either run the script [`2.0-2.1-fix-upgraded-resources.sh`](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/blob/release-2.1/docs/assets/2.0-2.1-fix-upgraded-resources.sh) found in [`/assets`](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/tree/release-2.1/docs/assets) or perform the required steps from that script manually.
