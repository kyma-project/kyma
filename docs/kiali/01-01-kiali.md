title: Overview

Kyma uses [Kiali](https://www.kiali.io) to enable validation, observe the Istio Service Mesh, and provide details on microservices included in the Service Mesh and connections between them.
Kiali offers a set of dashboards and graphs that allow to have the full service mesh at a glance and quickly identify problems and configuration issues.
For a more detailed feature documentation, please refer to the [official kiali documentation](https://kiali.io/documentation/features/).


>**NOTE:** Kiali is disabled by default in Kyma Lite (local installation). Read [this](/root/kyma/#configuration-custom-component-installation) document for instructions on how to enable it.
