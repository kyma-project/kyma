title: Overview
---

Runtime Agent is an integral part of every Runtime and it fetches the latest configuration from [Compass](https://github.com/kyma-incubator/compass). It also provides Runtime-specific information that is displayed in the Compass UI, such as Runtime UI URL, and it provides Compass with Runtime configuration, such as Event Gateway URL, that should be passed to an Application.
In the future releases, Runtime Agent will send Runtime health checks to Compass.
