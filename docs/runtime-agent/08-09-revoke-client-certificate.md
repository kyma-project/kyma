type: Tutorials
---

After you have established a secure connection with Compass and generated a client certificate, you may want to revoke this certificate at some point. To revoke a client certificate, follow the steps in this tutorial.

> **NOTE:** A revoked client certificate remains valid until it expires, but it cannot be renewed.

## Prerequisites

- [OpenSSL toolkit](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/apps/openssl.html) to create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR), keys, and certificates which meet high security standards
- [Compass](https://github.com/kyma-incubator/compass)
- Registered Application
- Runtime connected to Compass
- [Established secure connection with Compass](#tutorials-establish-a-secure-connection-with-compass)

> **NOTE**: To see how to maintain a secure connection with Compass and renew a client certificate, read the [tutorial](#tutorials-maintain-a-secure-connection-with-compass).

## Steps

1. Revoke the client certificate

    To revoke a client certificate, make a call to the Certificate-Secured Connector URL using the client certificate.
    The Certificate-Secured Connector URL is the `certificateSecuredConnectorURL` obtained when establishing a secure connection with Compass.
    Send this mutation with the call:

    ```graphql
    mutation { result: revokeCertificate }
    ```

    A successful call returns the following response:

    ```json
    {"data":{"result":true}}
    ```
