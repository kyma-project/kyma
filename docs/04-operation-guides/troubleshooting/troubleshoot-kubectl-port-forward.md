title: Issues with port forwarding
type: Troubleshooting
---

# Condition
When executing `kubectl port-forward` I get the following error:
```bash
Unable to listen on port ... bind: address already in use
```

# Cause
Port forwarding failed because the local port is already reserved by another process running on your machine.

# Remedy
There are several ways to fix this:
* Kill the other process listening on the same port.
* Choose another (unused) local port.
* Let `kubectl` choose a random unused local port for you (see the [Kubernetes port forwarding documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/port-forward-access-application-cluster/#let-kubectl-choose-local-port))

`kubectl port-forward` can fail with an error message `unable to listen on any of the requested ports` if the port is already reserved by another process running locally. To fix it, you can either kill the other process or change the local port to an unused one. You could also ask `kubectl` to choose a random unused local port for you: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/port-forward-access-application-cluster/#let-kubectl-choose-local-port.
