title: Security Concept and Roles
type: Security
---

To ensure a stable and secure work environment, the Kyma security component uses the following tools:

- Predefined [Kubernetes RBAC roles](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) to manage the user access to the functionality provided by Kyma.
- Istio Service Mesh with the global mTLS setup and ingress configuration to ensure secure service-to-service communication.

### Cluster-wide authorization

Roles in Kyma are defined as ClusterRoles and use the Kubernetes mechanism of aggregation, which allows you to combine multiple ClusterRoles into a single ClusterRole. Use the aggregation mechanism to efficiently manage access to Kubernetes and Kyma-specific resources.

>**NOTE:** Read the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#aggregated-clusterroles) to learn more about the aggregation mechanism used to define Kyma roles.

The predefined roles are:

| Role | Default group | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **kyma-essentials** | `runtimeDeveloper` | The basic role required to allow the users to access the Console UI of the cluster. This role doesn't give the user rights to modify any resources. |
| **kyma-namespace-admin-essentials** | `runtimeNamespaceAdmin` | The role that allows the user to access the Console UI and create Namespaces, built on top of the **kyma-essentials** role. Used to give the members of selected groups the ability to create Namespaces in which the [Permission Controller](#details-permission-controller) binds them to the **kyma-namespace-admin** role. |
| **kyma-view** | `runtimeOperator` | The role for listing Kubernetes and Kyma-specific resources. |
| **kyma-edit** | None | The role for editing Kyma-specific resources. It's [aggregated](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#aggregated-clusterroles) by other roles. |
| **kyma-developer** | None | The role created for developers who build implementations using Kyma. It allows you to list and edit Kubernetes and Kyma-specific resources. You need to bind it manually to a user or a group in the Namespaces of your choice. Use the `runtimeDeveloper` group when you run Kyma with the default `cluster-users` chart configuration. |
| **kyma-admin** | `runtimeAdmin` | The role with the highest permission level which gives access to all Kubernetes and Kyma resources and components with administrative rights. |
| **kyma-namespace-admin** | `runtimeNamespaceAdmin` | The role that has the same rights as the **kyma-admin** role, except for the write access to [AddonsConfigurations](https://kyma-project.io/docs/master/components/helm-broker#custom-resource-addons-configuration). The [Permission Controller](#details-permission-controller) automatically creates a RoleBinding to the `runtimeNamespaceAdmin` group in all non-system Namespaces. |

To learn more about the default roles and how they are constructed, see the [`rbac-roles.yaml`](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/blob/master/resources/cluster-users/templates/rbac-roles.yaml) file.
