---

Kyma Eventing provides several Grafana Dashboards so you can monitor statistics and other information for the Eventing backbone in real time.

> **NOTE:** See how to [expose Grafana securely](../security/sec-06-access-expose-kiali-grafana.md) for easier access in the future.

1. To access the Grafana Dashboard, port-forward the Grafana Service to localhost:

   ```bash
   kubectl -n kyma-system port-forward svc/monitoring-grafana 8081:80
   ```

2. Access the Grafana Dashboard on [localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081).

3. Select the Grafana Dashboard with the desired information about Kyma Eventing:
