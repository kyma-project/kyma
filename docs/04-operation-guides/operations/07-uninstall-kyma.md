title: Uninstall Kyma or components
---

To remove Kyma from a running Kubernetes cluster, use the `kyma undeploy` Kyma CLI command.

If you only want to remove single components, go to your [Helm](https://helm.sh/) client and modify the components as you need them.

> **NOTE:** To learn how to uninstall a Kyma module go to [Install, uninstall and upgrade Kyma with a module](../../02-get-started/08-install-uninstall-upgrade-kyma-module.md#uninstall-kyma-with-a-module).
