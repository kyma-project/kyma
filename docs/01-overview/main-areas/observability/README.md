title: What is Observability in Kyma?
---

Out of the box, Kyma provides tools to collect and ship telemetry data using the [Telemetry Module](../telemetry/README.md). Of course, you'll want to view and analyze the data you're collecting. This is where observability tools come in.

## Data Collection

Kyma collects telemetry data with the following in-cluster components:

- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction) collects metrics from Pods. Metrics are the time-stamped data that provide information on the running jobs, workload, CPU consumption, memory usage, and more. All metrics relevant for observing the in-cluster Istio Service Mesh are collected separately.

- [Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io/) collects logs, provided using the [Telemetry Module](../telemetry/README.md).

- An [OTel Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) collects traces, provided using the [Telemetry Module](../telemetry/README.md).

The collected telemetry data are exposed so that you can view and analyze them with observability tools.

> **NOTE:** Kyma's [telemetry component](../telemetry/README.md) supports providing your own output configuration for application logs and traces. With this, you can connect your own observability systems inside or outside the Kyma cluster with the Kyma backend.

## Data analysis

You can use the following in-cluster components to observe your applications' telemetry data:

- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction), a lightweight backend for metrics.
- [Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/), a lightweight backend for metrics. 
> **CAUTION:** the Loki integration got [deprecated](https://kyma-project.io/blog/2022/11/2/loki-deprecation/) and is planned to be removed.
- [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/), a tracing backend serving as the query mechanism to display information about traces.
> **CAUTION:** the Jaeger integration got [deprecated](https://kyma-project.io/blog/jaeger-deprecation) and is planned to be removed.
- [Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/guides/getting_started/) to provide a dashboard and a query editor to visualize metrics and logs collected from Prometheus and Loki.
