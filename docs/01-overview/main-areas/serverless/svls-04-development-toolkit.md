title: Development toolkit
---

To start developing your first Functions, you need:

- Self-hosted **Kubernetes cluster** and the **KUBECONFIG** file to authenticate to the cluster
- **Kyma** as the platform for managing the Function-related workloads
- [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/) as the container runtime
- [**kubectl**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/kubectl/), the Kubernetes command-line tool, for running commands against clusters
- Development environment of your choice:
   - **Kyma CLI** to easily initiate inline Functions or Git Functions locally, run, test, and later apply them on the clusters
   - **Node.js** (v14 or v16) or **Python** (v3.9)
   - **IDE** as the source code editor
   - **Kyma Dashboard** to manage Functions and related workloads through the graphical user interface
