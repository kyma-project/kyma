title: What is Serverless in Kyma?
---

Serverless in Kyma is an area that:

- Ensures quick deployments following a Function approach
- Enables scaling independent of the core applications
- Gives a possibility to revert changes without causing production system downtime
- Supports the complete asynchronous programming model
- Offers loose coupling of Event providers and consumers
- Enables flexible application scalability and availability

Serverless in Kyma allows you to reduce the implementation and operation effort of an application to the absolute minimum. It provides a platform to run lightweight Functions in a cost-efficient and scalable way using JavaScript and Node.js. Serverless in Kyma relies on Kubernetes resources like [Deployments](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/), [Services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) and [Horizontal Pod Autoscalers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/) for deploying and managing Functions and [Kubernetes Jobs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/) for creating Docker images.
