title: Busola - Kyma Dashboard
---

Busola is a web-based UI for managing resources within Kyma or any Kubernetes cluster. It consists of separate micro frontend applications managed by the Luigi framework.

Busola has a dedicated Node.js backend, which is a proxy for a [Kubernetes API server](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#kube-apiserver).
