To perform tasks with Eventing, go through these tutorials:

- [Tutorial: Send events without a Kyma Application](../../../03-tutorials/eventing/evnt-01-setup-in-cluster-eventing.md) - explains how to send events without the need for a Kyma Application.

> **NOTE:** The two tutorials below are part of the Getting Started Guide and are not meant to be standalone. As a prerequisite you should complete the previous tutorials first, especially [Connect an external application](docs/get-started/08-connect-external-application.md).
