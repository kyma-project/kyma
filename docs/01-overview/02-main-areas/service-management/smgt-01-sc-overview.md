title: What is Service Management in Kyma?
---

Service Management in Kyma is based on service operators. Service operators help you provision third-party services on your Kubernetes cluster by providing all necessary resources needed to provision those services.

These are the operators provided by three main hyperscaler cloud providers that you can install on your Kyma cluster:
- [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/how-to/getting-started)
- [Azure](https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-operator)
- [AWS](https://github.com/aws-controllers-k8s/community)
