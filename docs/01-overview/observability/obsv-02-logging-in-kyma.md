## Overview
For in-cluster logging, Kyma uses [Loki](https://github.com/grafana/loki), a Prometheus-like log management system.

> **NOTE:** Loki is [deprecated](https://kyma-project.io/blog/2022/11/2/loki-deprecation/) and is planned to be removed. Kyma's [telemetry component](../telemetry/README.md) supports providing your own output configuration for Fluent Bit. With this, you can connect your own observability systems inside or outside the Kyma cluster.

## Limitations

In the production profile, Loki stores up to **30 GB** of data for a maximum of **5 days**, with maximum ingestion rate of 3 MB/s. If the default time is exceeded, the oldest logs are removed first.

The evaluation profile has lower limits. For more information about profiles, see [Install Kyma: Choose resource consumption](../../../04-operation-guides/operations/02-install-kyma.md#choose-resource-consumption).
