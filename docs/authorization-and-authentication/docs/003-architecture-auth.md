The following diagram illustrates the authorization and authentication flow in Kyma. The representation assumes the Kyma Console UI as the user's point of entry.

1. The user opens the Kyma Console UI. If the Console application doesn't find a JWT token in the browser session storage, it redirects the user's browser to the Open ID Connect (OIDC) provider, Dex.
2. Dex lists all defined Identity Provider connectors to the user. The user selects the Identity Provider to authenticate with. After successful authentication, the browser is redirected back to the OIDC provider which issues a JWT token to the user. After obtaining the token, the browser is redirected back to the Console UI. The Console UI stores the token in the Session Storage and uses it for all subsequent requests.
3. The Console UI requests for a list of cluster resources in Environments from the API Server. The API Server is not accessible directly. The request is routed through the API Server Proxy - a simple Nginx reverse proxy exposed through an Istio Ingress.
4. The request arrives at the Kubernetes API Server. The Kubernetes API Server validates the JWT token it received and directs the request accordingly if the validation is successful.

>**NOTE:** The Kubernetes API Server can verify JWT tokens issued by Dex because Dex is registered as a trusted issuer through OIDC parameters during the Kyma installation.
