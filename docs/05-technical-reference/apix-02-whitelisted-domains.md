title: Allowed domains in API Gateway Controller
---

API Gateway Controller uses an allowlist of domains for which it allows to expose services. Every time a user creates a new APIRule custom resource (CR) for a service, API Gateway Controller checks the domain of the service specified in the CR against the allowlist. If the domain of the service matches an allowed entry, API Gateway Controller creates a VirtualService and Oathkeeper Access Rules for the service according to the details specified in the CR. If the domain is not allowed, the Controller creates neither a VirtualService nor Oathkeeper Access Rules and, as a result, does not expose the service.

If the domain does not match the allowlist, API Gateway Controller sets an appropriate validation status on the APIRule CR created for that service.

>**TIP:** For more information, read about the [APIRule CR statuses](./00-custom-resources/apix-01-apirule.md#status-codes).

By default, the only allowed domain is the domain of the Kyma cluster.
