>**WARNING:** The current API version is `serverless.kyma-project.io/v1alpha2`. The `serverless.kyma-project.io/v1alpha1` version is still supported but deprecated. For the v1alpha1 version, see the [previous Function documentation](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/blob/release-2.5/docs/05-technical-reference/00-custom-resources/svls-01-function.md).

The `functions.serverless.kyma-project.io` CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) is a detailed description of the kind of data and the format used to manage Functions within Kyma. To get the up-to-date CRD and show the output in the YAML format, run this command:

```bash
kubectl get crd functions.serverless.kyma-project.io -o yaml
```

## Sample custom resource

The following Function object creates a Function which responds to HTTP requests with the "Hello John" message. The Function's code (**source**) and dependencies (**dependencies**) are specified in the Function CR.

```yaml
apiVersion: serverless.kyma-project.io/v1alpha2
kind: Function

  name: my-test-function
  namespace: default
  labels:
    app: my-test-function

        module.exports = {
          main: function(event, context) {
            const name = process.env.PERSON_NAME;
            return 'Hello ' + name;
          }
        }

        reason: ConfigMapCreated
        status: "True"
        type: ConfigurationReady
```

If you store the Function's source code and dependencies in a Git repository and want the Function Controller to fetch them from it, use these parameters in the Function CR:

```yaml
apiVersion: serverless.kyma-project.io/v1alpha2
kind: Function
metadata:
  name: my-test-function
spec:
  source:
    gitRepository:
      url: github.com/username/repo
      baseDir: "/"
      reference: "branchA"
      auth:
        type: basic
        secretName: secret-name
  runtime: "nodejs14"
```

| **status.conditions.reason**             | Not applicable | Provides information on the Function CR processing success or failure. See the [**Reasons**](#status-reasons) section for the full list of possible status reasons and their descriptions. All status reasons are in camelCase.   |
| **status.conditions.status**             | Not applicable | Describes the status of processing the Function CR by the Function Controller. It can be `True` for success, `False` for failure, or `Unknown` if the CR processing is still in progress. If the status of all conditions is `True`, the overall status of the Function CR is ready.     |
| **status.conditions.type**               | Not applicable | Describes a substage of the Function CR processing. There are three condition types that a Function has to meet to be ready: `ConfigurationReady`, `BuildReady`, and `Running`. When displaying the Function status in the terminal, these types are shown under `CONFIGURED`, `BUILT`, and `RUNNING` columns respectively. All condition types can change asynchronously depending on the type of Function modification, but all three need to be in the `True` status for the Function to be considered successfully processed. |

### Status reasons

Processing of a Function CR can succeed, continue, or fail for one of these reasons:
