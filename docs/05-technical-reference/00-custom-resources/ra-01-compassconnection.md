The `compassconnections.compass.kyma-project.io` CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) 
is a detailed description of the kind of data and the format used to preserve 
the status of the connection between the Runtime Agent and Compass. 
The `CompassConnection` custom resource (CR) contains the connection statuses and Compass URLs.
To get the up-to-date CRD and show the output in the `yaml` format, run this command:

```bash
kubectl get crd compassconnections.compass.kyma-project.io -o yaml
```
