title: Application

The `applications.applicationconnector.kyma-project.io` custom resource definition (CRD) is a detailed description of the kind of data and the format used to register an Application in Kyma. The `Application` custom resource (CR) defines the APIs that the Application offers. To get the up-to-date CRD and show the output in the YAML format, run this command:

```bash
kubectl get crd applications.applicationconnector.kyma-project.io -o yaml
```

## Sample custom resource

This is a sample resource that registers the `system-prod` Application which offers one service.

>**NOTE:** The name of the Application must consist of lower case alphanumeric characters, `-` or `.`, and start and end with an alphanumeric character.

>**NOTE:** In case the Application name contains `-` or `.`, the underlying Eventing services uses a clean name with alphanumeric characters only. (For example, `system-prod` becomes `systemprod`).
>
> This could lead to a naming collision. For example, both `system-prod` and `systemprod` become `systemprod`.
>
> A solution for this is to provide an `application-type` label (with alphanumeric characters only) which is then used by the Eventing services instead of the Application name. If the `application-type` label also contains `-` or `.`, the underlying Eventing services clean it and use the cleaned label.

```yaml
apiVersion: applicationconnector.kyma-project.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: system-prod
spec:
  description: This is the system-production Application.
  labels:
    region: us
    kind: production
```
