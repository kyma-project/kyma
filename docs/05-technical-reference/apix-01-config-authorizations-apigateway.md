title: Configure Authorization (OAuth2, JWT)
---

With the API Gateway Controller, you can secure the services you expose in the following ways:

- with OAuth2 tokens
- with JWT tokens
- with both OAuth2 and JWT tokens

If you secure a service with either OAuth2 or JWT tokens, by default, you must include a valid OAuth2 or JWT token in the `Authorization` header of the call to the service.

If you secure a service with both OAuth2 and JWT, by default, the Oathkeeper proxy expects OAuth2 tokens in the `Authorization` header of incoming calls. For endpoints secured with JWT, you must define the header from which the system extracts the JWT token for every **accessStrategy** you define. Set the **token_from.location** parameter to `header:{NAME}` to extract the JWT token from a specific header. You can use any header name different from `Authorization`.

Alternatively, you can set the **token_from.location** parameter to `query_parameter:{NAME}` to extract the token from a specific query parameter.

>**TIP:** You can define the location of OAuth2 token through the **token_from.location** parameter. However, by default, OAuth2 tokens are extracted from the `Authorization` header.

## Examples

See these sample excerpts from APIRule custom resources that show the **rules** attribute for services secured with OAuth2, JWT, and an OAuth2 and JWT combination.
