Jaeger was deprecated with Kyma 2.11 and has been removed with Kyma 2.14. After upgrading to Kyma 2.14, run the script [2.13-2.14-cleanup-jaeger.sh](./assets/2.13-2.14-cleanup-jaeger.sh) to remove Jaeger.
> **NOTE** If you want to continue using Jaeger, deploy the [Jaeger example](https://github.com/kyma-project/examples/tree/main/jaeger).
