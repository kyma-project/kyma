# Documentation

## Overview

The `docs` folder contains end-to-end documentation on Kyma and its components.

Start with the overarching [Kyma](kyma/docs) documentation where you can find the general information on Kyma and the Getting Started guides. Then, read about the product in more detail:   

* [API Gateway](api-gateway/docs)
* [Application Connector](application-connector/docs/)
* [Authorization and Authentication](authorization-and-authentication/docs/)
* [Event Bus](event-bus/docs/)
* [Monitoring](monitoring/docs/)
* [Serverless](serverless/docs/)
* [Service Brokers](service-brokers/docs/)
* [Service Catalog](service-catalog/docs/)
* [Service Mesh](service-mesh/docs/)
* [Tracing](tracing/docs/)

Read it directly in GitHub or inside the Kyma Console if you have access to the Kyma cluster.

The navigation order of the documentation page is based on the [Manifest](manifest.yaml) file.
