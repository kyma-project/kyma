# Documentation

# Overview

The `docs` folder contains end-to-end documentation on Kyma.

Start with the overarching [Kyma](./kyma) documentation where you can find the general information on Kyma and the [Getting Started guides](./getting-started/).

Read it directly in GitHub or inside the Kyma Console if you have access to the Kyma cluster.

The navigation order of the documentation page is based on the **rafter.kyma-project.io/order** label specified in the [ClusterAssetGroup](../resources/core/charts/docs/charts/content-ui/templates) for a given Kyma component.

## Development

Follow these basic rules when you add a new document to the official Kyma documentation:

1. Get familiar with the [Content Strategy](https://github.com/kyma-project/community/blob/master/guidelines/content-guidelines/01-content-strategy.md) to learn about the Kyma's official approach to content development.
2. Follow the [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/kyma-project/community/blob/master/contributing/02-contributing.md) for the general contribution rules and process.
3. Make use of the [templates](https://github.com/kyma-project/community/tree/master/guidelines/templates) to structure your documents properly.
4. Be compliant with the writing [guidelines](https://github.com/kyma-project/community/blob/master/guidelines/content-guidelines) to contribute high-quality and standardized content.
