## Overview

The use of Knative Eventing shifts the eventing paradigm in Kyma to an eventing mesh with isolated fault domains, access control and dynamic event routing where many senders inject events into the mesh from multiple source points, and many subscribers receive all or a subset of those events based on filters and access control. 
Thanks to the concepts of [Knative Broker and Trigger](https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/broker-trigger/), the process of Event publishing and consumption runs smoother and greatly improves the overall performance.  


## Architecture

The diagram shows you how the events are consumed and published.

![Event Service Class](./assets/knative-eventing-mesh.svg)

This ServiceClass has a **bindable** parameter set to `false` which means that after provisioning a ServiceClass in the Namespace, given events are ready to use for all services. The provisioning workflow for an event ServiceClass consists of the following steps:

1. Select a given event ServiceClass from the Service Catalog.
2. Provision this ServiceClass by creating a ServiceInstance in the given Namespace.
3. The Service Catalog sends a provisioning request to the Application Broker with the Application and the Namespace details.
4. The Application Broker labels the Namespace with `knative-eventing-injection=enabled`, which will trigger the installation of the default Knative Eventing Broker in that Namespace.
5. The Application Broker creates a Knative Subscription in the `kyma-integration` Namespace to wire the Application's HTTPSource and the Namespace's default Knative Eventing Broker.
6. Create a Knative Trigger from the Kyma Console UI for a Lambda with a particular event type.
7. The Application sends events to the Application Connector.
8. The Application Connector sends events to Application's HTTPSource deployed inside the `kyma-integration` Namespace.
9. The Application's HTTPSource sends events the Applications Knative Channel inside the `kyma-integration` Namespace.
10. The Knative Channel sends events to the user Namespace's default Knative Eventing Broker. This happens as a result of the created Knative Subscription by the Application Broker.
11. The Knative Trigger delivers events to the Lambda for a particular event type.
