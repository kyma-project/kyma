## Overview

Knative Eventing Mesh leverages Knative Eventing components to build an eventing mesh that provides event routing and pub/sub capabilities. It abstracts the underlying messaging system and allows you to configure different persistence for each Namespace. Kyma components wire the mesh dynamically for event routing. This way, senders can inject Events into the mesh from multiple source points, and subscribers can receive Events based on filters and their access permissions. The [Knative Broker and Trigger](https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/broker-trigger/) CRDs allow the process of Event publishing and consumption to run smoother, thus significantly improving the overall performance.   

 >**NOTE:** Knative Eventing Mesh is available in the alpha version. Use it only for testing purposes.
 
The new Eventing Mesh runs in parallel with the existing Event Bus. The Kyma Event Bus still supports sending Events to the regular eventing endpoint, while a separate Kyma endpoint handles sending Events to the new Knative Eventing Mesh. 

## Event Flow

### Send Events

The diagram shows you the main stages of the Event flow - from the moment the external Application sends it, up to the point when the lambda function receives it. 

>**NOTE**: The flow assumes you have already added a service instance of an external Application to your Namespace in the Kyma Console and created a lambda with an Event trigger. 

![Sending Events](./assets/knative-event-mesh-send-events.svg)

1. The Application sends Events to the [HTTP source adapter](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/tree/master/components/event-sources/adapter/http) which is an HTTP server deployed inside the `kyma-integration` Namespace.  

2. The HTTP source adapter forwards the Events to the default [Knative Broker](https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/broker-trigger).

3. The Knative Broker then delivers Events to the proper lambda function. 

### Subscribe to Events 

In the new Knative Eventing Mesh, you can use Knative Triggers to subscribe to any Events delivered to the Broker located in your Namespace.

You can also use expressions that allow the Trigger to filter the incoming Events. For details on setting filters, read the **Trigger filtering** section in [this](https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/broker-trigger/) document. 

## Test Knative Eventing Mesh

To reach the new Eventing Mesh, use an HTTP request with the `/events` path. 
For example, if you have used `gateway.example.cx/v1/events` so far, use `gateway.example.cx/events` to make sure you work with the new Eventing Mesh. 

>**NOTE:** The HTTP source adapter only accepts Events compliant with the [CloudEvents 1.0 specification](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0/spec.md).

## Channel implementations

By default, Kyma comes with [NatssChannel](https://github.com/knative/eventing-contrib/tree/master/natss/config), however, Knative eventing allows you to change the default channel implementation or even use multiple channels simultaneously.
You can [override](/root/kyma/#configuration-helm-overrides-for-kyma-installation) the default channel implementation during installation like this:

```bash
$ cat << EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: knative-eventing-overrides
  namespace: kyma-installer
  labels:
    installer: overrides
    component: knative-eventing
    kyma-project.io/installation: ""
data:
  knative-eventing.channel.default.apiVersion: knativekafka.kyma-project.io/v1alpha1
  knative-eventing.channel.default.kind: KafkaChannel
EOF
```

In this example, the default channel is set to Kafka.

### Kafka

You can use a Knative-compatible [Kafka channel implementation](https://github.com/kyma-incubator/knative-kafka). The following section explains you how to configure the connection between Kyma and your Kafka cluster and how to install Kyma with the Kafka-Channel controller. 

>**NOTE:** Kafka Channel integration is in alpha version. Use it only for testing purposes.

The Knative-channel implementation supports [the following providers](https://github.com/kyma-incubator/knative-kafka/blob/9eb3fa3f6e67ffc80b162d2ef4c8a8a3942d9c5f/resources/README.md#kafka-providers). Use the links to set up a Kafka cluster.

* [Azure Event Hubs](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/event-hubs/)
* [Confluent Cloud](https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud)
* [Standard Kafka installation with no special authorization required](https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart)

Before starting the Kyma installation, configure the connection between Kyma and the Kafka cluster. To do so, use the installation override:

```bash
$ export kafkaBrokers={todo user}
$ export kafkaNamespace={todo user}
$ export kafkaPassword={todo user}
$ export kafkaUsername={todo user}
$ export kafkaProvider={local|azure|confluent}

$ cat << EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: knative-kafka-overrides
  namespace: kyma-installer
  labels:
    installer: overrides
    component: knative-eventing-channel-kafka
    kyma-project.io/installation: ""
type: Opaque    
stringData:
  kafka.brokers: $kafkaBrokers
  kafka.namespace: $kafkaNamespace
  kafka.password: $kafkaPassword
  kafka.username: $kafkaUsername
  kafka.secretName: knative-kafka
  environment.kafkaProvider: $kafkaProvider
EOF
```

>**NOTE:** For additional values, see [this](https://github.com/kyma-incubator/knative-kafka/blob/master/resources/knative-kafka/values.yaml) file.

Once the installation has been customized, you can trigger the Kyma installation.
You can install Kyma with a `knative-eventing-channel-kafka` custom component by following these [instructions](/root/kyma/#configuration-custom-component-installation). The TestDefinition for the component is `knative-eventing-channel-kafka-test`.
