Loki has been removed with Kyma 2.17. After upgrading to Kyma 2.17, run the script [2.16-2.17-cleanup-loki.sh](./assets/2.16-2.17-cleanup-loki.sh) to remove Loki.

> **NOTE** If you want to continue using Loki, you can install a [custom Loki stack](https://github.com/kyma-project/examples/tree/main/loki).
