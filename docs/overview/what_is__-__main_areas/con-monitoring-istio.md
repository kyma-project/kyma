The monitoring chart is pre-configured to collect all metrics relevant for observing the in-cluster [Istio](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/observability/) Service Mesh, including the proxy-level, service-level, and control-plane metrics.

The concept of collecting the [service-level](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/observability/#service-level-metrics) metrics is built around the Istio Proxy implemented by Envoy. Istio Proxy collects all communication details inside the service mesh in a decentralized way. After scraping these high cardinality metrics from the envoys, the metrics need to be additionally aggregated on a service level to get the final service-related details.

Following the [Istio's observability best practice](https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/best-practices/observability/), the scraping and aggregation of the service-level metrics is done in a dedicated Prometheus instance. That instance has the smallest possible data retention time configured as the raw metrics scraped from the Istio Proxies have high cardinality and are not further required to be kept. Instead, the main Prometheus instance scrapes the aggregated metrics through the `/federate` endpoint.

The Istio-related instance is a Deployment named `monitoring-prometheus-istio-server`. This instance has a short data retention time and hardcoded configuration that should not be changed. It also has no PersistentVolume attached. This instance never discovers additional metric endpoints from such resources as ServiceMonitors.

See the diagram for a broader view of how the Istio-related instance fits into the monitoring setup in Kyma:

By default, `monitoring-prometheus-istio-server` is not provided as a data source in Grafana. However, this can be enabled by adding the override: 

 ```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: monitoring-overrides
  namespace: kyma-installer
  labels:
    installer: overrides
    component: monitoring
    kyma-project.io/installation: ""
data:
    prometheus-istio.grafana.datasource.enabled: "true"
EOF
```

Run the [cluster update process](/root/kyma/#installation-update-kyma). After finishing the upgrade process, restart the Grafana deployment by using this command:

```bash
kubectl rollout restart -n kyma-system deployment monitoring-grafana
```
