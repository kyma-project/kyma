# Migrate from v1.1 to v1.2

## Event Bus

The 1.2 release updates the Knative eventing version to 0.5 from 0.4. This brings in considerable changes to the Knative eventing CRDs which cannot be automatically done in Kyma update. To accommodate them, the following post update steps needs to be followed.

1. Delete all the existing Knative eventing subscription custom resources. They will be recreated after all  the steps are completed.

    ```bash
    kubectl delete subscriptions.eventing.knative.dev --all -n kyma-system
    ```
 
2. Delete all the existing Knative eventing channels custom resources. They will be recreated after all  the steps are completed.
    
    ```bash
    kubectl delete channels.eventing.knative.dev --all -n kyma-system
    ```

3. Apply all the Knative eventing CRDs that have delta in 0.5 release.

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kyma-project/kyma/master/components/event-bus/cmd/event-bus-crd-update-job/crds.yaml
    ```

4. Restart the subscription controller pod. This will reconcile all the Kyma subscriptions and the create all the Knative channels and subscriptions.

    ```bash
    kubectl delete pod -l app=event-bus-subscription-controller-knative -n kyma-system
    ```
