# Migrate from v1.3 to v1.4

>**TIP:** To learn more about upgrading Kyma, read [this](https://kyma-project.io/docs/master/root/kyma/#installation-upgrade-kyma) document.

## Service Management

We have removed the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Service Broker addon, as the broker itself is being deprecated. If you have already installed the GCP Service Broker in Kyma 1.3, you will still see this addon. You can manage the existing GCP services using Kyma until November 5, 2019. On or after that time, you will be able to manage services using the API, the command line, or Google Cloud Platform Console.

If you have installed the GCP Service Broker addon but haven't provisioned any of its services in your Namespace, delete the GCP Service Broker instance from the Namespace. If you have provisioned any GCP Service Broker services, consider removing the ones that you don't need. To do so, follow these steps:
1. Delete all bindings to GCP Service Instances.
2. Delete all GCP Service Instances.
3. Delete all GCP Service Broker instances.

The charges incurred by the remaining resources created through the GCP Service Broker will continue to accrue. For more information, read the official Google Cloud [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/google-cloud-platform-service-broker).
