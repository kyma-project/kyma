# Migrate from v1.7 to v1.8

## Monitoring

We have increased the size of Persistent Volume Claims (PVC) for Prometheus to 10GB to prevent it from running out of disk space. Unfortunately, the standard upgrade procedure does not resize the volumes automatically, as the volume expansion through StatefulSets is not supported.
To make sure PVC size is 10GB, perform the following steps:

1. Increase PVC size:

```
kubectl patch pvc prometheus-monitoring-db-prometheus-monitoring-0 -n kyma-system -p '{"spec":{"resources":{"requests":{"storage":"10Gi"}}}}'
```
2. Delete the `prometheus-monitoring-0` Pod:  

```
kubectl delete pod prometheus-monitoring-0 -n kyma-system
```
The Pod will recreate with the PVC size already increased.
