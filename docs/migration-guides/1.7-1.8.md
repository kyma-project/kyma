# Migrate from v1.7 to v1.8

>**TIP:** To learn more about upgrading Kyma, read [this](https://kyma-project.io/docs/master/root/kyma/#installation-upgrade-kyma) document.


## Monitoring

In Kyma 1.8, we increased the size of Persistent Volume Claims (PVC) for Prometheus to 10GB to prevent Prometheus from running out of disk space. Unfortunately, the standard upgrade procedure does not auto resize the volumes as the volume expansion through StatefulSets is not supported.
To make sure the PVC size is 10GB, perform the following steps:

1. Increase the PVC size:

```
kubectl patch pvc prometheus-monitoring-db-prometheus-monitoring-0 -n kyma-system -p '{"spec":{"resources":{"requests":{"storage":"10Gi"}}}}'
```
2. Delete the `prometheus-monitoring-0` Pod, so it can recreate with increased PVC. 

```
kubectl delete pod prometheus-monitoring-0 -n kyma-system
```
