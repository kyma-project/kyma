# Migrate from v1.7 to v1.8

>**TIP:** To learn more about upgrading Kyma, read [this](https://kyma-project.io/docs/master/root/kyma/#installation-upgrade-kyma) document.


## Monitoring

We have increased the size of Persistent Volume Claims (PVC) for Prometheus to 10GB to prevent it from running out of disk space. The automatic upgrade procedure does not resize the volumes automatically, as the volume expansion through StatefulSets is not supported. As a result, you must trigger the Prometheus PVC size change manually.
Follow these steps:

1. Increase the PVC size:

```
kubectl patch pvc prometheus-monitoring-db-prometheus-monitoring-0 -n kyma-system -p '{"spec":{"resources":{"requests":{"storage":"10Gi"}}}}'
```

Once you run the command, wait a bit before proceeding to the next step to make sure the changes were applied. 

2. Delete the Pod:  

```
kubectl delete pod prometheus-monitoring-0 -n kyma-system
```
The Pod will recreate with the PVC size increased.

>**NOTE:** If you have more than one replica, perform the steps for each of them.
