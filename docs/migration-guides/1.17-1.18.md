# Migrate from 1.17 to 1.18

## Istio Kyma patch

In Kyma 1.18, we migrate the logic from the Istio Kyma patch to a [TestDefinition](https://kyma-project.io/docs/#details-testing-kyma) which resides in the Istio chart. After the upgrade, it is no longer needed to keep the Istio Kyma patch on the cluster, so it can be safely deleted.
 
To remove the `istio-kyma-patch` chart, run:

```bash
helm delete istio-kyma-patch -n istio-system
```
