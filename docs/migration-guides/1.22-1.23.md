# Migrate from 1.22 to 1.23

## Increase the Loki volume size
In Kyma 1.23.0, the default Loki volume size requested by the persistent volume claim has been increased from 10Gi to 30Gi because the retention time for logs has been increased from 1 day to 5 days. 

> If you are using a custom volume size for the Loki persistent volume claim, we recommend that you evaluate whether that volume size is sufficient to retain the logs for 5 days.

## Upgrade process
During the upgrade process, the pre-upgrade job increases the volume size from 10Gi to 30Gi. 
For the upgrade process to be successful, make sure that the field `allowVolumeExpansion` is set to `true` for the storage class. For more information, read the [Kubernetes documentation about Expanding Persistent Volumes Claims](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#expanding-persistent-volumes-claims).

If the flag is not set on the storage class, the size of the volume would not change. Use the following command to check the size of the volume:

```
kubectl get persistentvolumeclaims -n kyma-system storage-logging-loki-0
```
If the size is still the old size, delete the old persistent volume claim with the following command:

```
kubectl delete statefulsets.apps -n kyma-system logging-loki

kubectl delete persistentvolumeclaims -n kyma-system storage-logging-loki-0
```
After the old persistent volume claim is deleted, trigger the Kyma update.
