# Migrate from 1.22 to 1.23

## Increase the Loki volume size
In Kyma 1.23.0, the Loki volume size requested by the persistent volume claim has been increased from 10Gi to 30Gi

## Upgrade process
During the upgrade process, the pre-upgrade job is patching the volume size so as to increase the size from 10Gi to 30Gi. However, the upgrade process would succeed if the field `allowVolumeExpansion` is set to `true` for the storage class. Please look [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#expanding-persistent-volumes-claims) for more info. If the flag is not set then follow the steps below and then trigger update

```
kubectl delete statefulsets.apps -n kyma-system logging-loki

kubectl delete persistentvolumeclaims -n kyma-system storage-logging-loki-0
```
> This action will delete the existing data.
