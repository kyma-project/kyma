# Migrate from 1.22 to 1.23

## Increase the Loki volume size
In Kyma 1.23.0, the size of the persistent volume claim has been increased from 10Gi to 30Gi

### Upgrade process

The upgrade process increases the size of the persistence volume claim for loki from 10Gi to 30Gi.

The pre-upgrade script first tries to increase the size of persistence volume claim but if it fails then it would delete the persistence volume claim so that a new claim can be created with 30 Gi
