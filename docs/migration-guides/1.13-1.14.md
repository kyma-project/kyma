# Migrate from v1.13 to v1.14

## Upgrade

The migration of Kyma components from Helm v2 to Helm v3 is done automatically. The kyma-installer init container migrates the Kyma components before the upgrade process starts. For more details, read about [migration to Helm v3](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/blob/release-1.14/docs/kyma/03-03-charts.md#migration-to-helm-v3).
