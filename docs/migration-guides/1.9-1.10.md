# Migrate from v1.9 to v1.10

## Installation

In this release we upgraded Istio to 1.4.3 that requires a new version of Tiller. Before upgrading to Kyma 1.10, you must upgrade Tiller using the `tiller.yaml` file from the Kyma GitHub release artifacts.

Use this command:

```yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kyma-project/kyma/release-1.10/installation/resources/tiller.yaml
```
>**TIP:** To upgrade Kyma, read [this](https://kyma-project.io/docs/master/root/kyma/#installation-upgrade-kyma) document.
