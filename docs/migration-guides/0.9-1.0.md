# Migrate from v0.9 to v1.0

## API Gateway 

The 1.0 release introduces an important security upgrade and enables mutual TLS (mTLS) by default for communication between services. As a result, the API Controller adds the **peers.mtls** attribute to Istio Authentication Policies. This attribute enables mTLS for the service for which the Authentication Policy is created. If the Authentication Policy doesn't have the **peers.mtls** attribute, it doesn't have mTLS enabled.

If a service doesn't have mTLS enabled, it might not be visible to other services and its communication with other services might be compromised. 

To successfully migrate to Kyma v1.0, add the **peers.mtls** attribute to Authentication Policies created by the API Controller. Follow these steps: 

1. To get all Authentication Policies, run: 
  ```
  kubectl get policy --all-namespaces
  ```

2. Add the **peers.mtls** attribute to policies created by the API Controller before you upgraded Kyma to v1.0: 
  ```
  spec:
    peers:
    - mtls: {}
  ```
>**NOTE:** Enabling mTLS for a service is not instantaneous. Wait at least 30 seconds after you add the **peers.mtls** attribute for the changes to take effect.
