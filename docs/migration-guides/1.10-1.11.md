# Migrate from v1.10 to v1.11

## Knative Eventing Mesh 

To use new [Knative Eventing Mesh](https://kyma-project.io/docs/master/components/knative-eventing-mesh/#overview-overview), you must upgrade Kyma from version 1.10 to version 1.11. To do so, follow the [Kyma upgrade guide](https://kyma-project.io/docs/#installation-upgrade-kyma). 

**CAUTION**: Events sent during the migration can be lost.
    
### Verification

1. List all the applications:

    ```bash
     kubectl get applications 
    ```  
2. Check if each Application has a corresponding HTTP Source Adapter. 

    ```bash
    kubectl -n kyma-integration get pods 
    ```
3. Check if the Channel status is `READY`

4. Check if Kyma Subscriptions have been converted to Knative Triggers:

    ```bash
    kubectl -n test get triggers 
    ``` 
    **NOTE**: If any of the conditions above was not fulfilled, recreate the Application using the Kyma Console. If the           problem still exists, create a support ticket.

5. If you added a service using an EventsServiceClass, check if the service instance is present in your Namespace:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl -n test get serviceinstances.servicecatalog.k8s.io 
    ```
  
6. Check if a Broker exisits in your Namespace:
    
    ```bash
       kubectl -n test get brokers
    ```
    
7. Check if a Knative Subscription exists in the `kyma-integration` Namespace, linking the Knative Channel to the Knative        Broker: 

    ```bash
    kubectl -n kyma-integration get subscriptions.messaging.knative.dev 
    ```
8. Check if a subscriber URI in the Knative Subscription points to the Broker:

    ```bash
    kubectl -n kyma-integration get subscriptions.messaging.knative.dev brokersub-skqcq -o jsonpath='{ .spec.subscriber.uri }' 
    ```
    **NOTE**: If any of the conditions above was not fulfilled, delete the service instance and recreate it using the Kyma  Console. If the problem persists, create a support ticket.
    
9. After the migration, you can still use the existing Event Bus. To check the compatibility, try sending events to the legacy endpoint at https://gateway.domain/commerce/v1/events.
