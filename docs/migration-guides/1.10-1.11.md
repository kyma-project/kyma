# Migrate from v1.10 to v1.11

## CLI

In this release, we introduced changes to the Kyma installation process to avoid potential issues during the Kyma upgrade. We ensured compliance with the recent Kyma CLI version, but using older versions results in the following error displayed during Kyma installation:

```bash 
- Kyma Installer deployed 
X Configuring Helm 
Error: jobs.batch "helm-certs-job" not found 
``` 
To ensure error-free Kyma installation, [upgrade](https://github.com/kyma-project/cli#installation) the Kyma CLI to the latest version.

## Knative Eventing Mesh 

To use the new [Knative Eventing Mesh](https://kyma-project.io/docs/master/components/knative-eventing-mesh/#overview-overview), you must upgrade Kyma from version 1.10 to version 1.11. To do so, follow the [Kyma upgrade guide](https://kyma-project.io/docs/#installation-upgrade-kyma). 

**CAUTION**: Events sent during the migration can be lost.
    
### Verify migration

Perform the following steps to see if the migration process was successful.

1. List all the applications:

    ```bash
     kubectl get applications 
    ```  
2. Check if each Application has a corresponding HTTP Source Adapter. 

    ```bash
    kubectl -n kyma-integration get httpsource
    ```
3. Check if the Channel status is `READY`
    ```bash
    kubectl -n kyma-integration get channels
   ```
4. Check if Kyma Subscriptions have been converted to Knative Triggers:

    ```bash
    kubectl -n <YOUR_NAMESPACE> get triggers 
    ``` 
    **NOTE**: If any of the steps results in a failure, recreate the Application using the Kyma Console. If the           problem persists, create a support ticket.

5. If you added a service using an EventsServiceClass, check if the service instance is present in your Namespace:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl -n <YOUR_NAMESPACE> get serviceinstances.servicecatalog.k8s.io 
    ```
  
6. Check if a Broker exists in your Namespace:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl -n <YOUR_NAMESPACE> get brokers
    ```
7. Check of the Eventing Mesh is enabled for your Namespace:
    ```bash
    kubectl get ns -lknative-eventing-injection=enabled
    ```
    
8. Check if a Knative Subscription exists in the `kyma-integration` Namespace, linking the Knative Channel to the Knative        Broker: 

    ```bash
    kubectl -n kyma-integration get subscriptions.messaging.knative.dev 
    ```
9. Check if a subscriber URI in the Knative Subscription points to the Broker:

    ```bash
    kubectl -n kyma-integration get subscriptions.messaging.knative.dev -o jsonpath='{ .items[*].spec.subscriber.uri }' -lapplication-name 
    ```
    **NOTE**: If any of the steps results in a failure, delete the service instance and recreate it using the Kyma  Console. If the problem persists, create a support ticket.
    
### Eventing endpoints

After the migration, use the new Knative Eventing Mesh endpoint, `https://gateway.domain/APP_NAME/events`, to send events.

**NOTE**: The old endpoint, `https://gateway.domain/APP_NAME/v1/events`, will be handled by the compatibility layer which uses the new Eventing Mesh to route events from the old endpoints to the sinks.
