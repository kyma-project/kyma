# Migrate from 1.18 to 1.19

## Istio

Kyma 1.19 comes with a new Istio version: 1.8.1. See what changes in the [official Istio upgrade notes](https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.8.x/announcing-1.8/).

Ensure Istio sidecars for all Pods are in the proper version after the upgrade. See the [troubleshooting guide](https://kyma-project.io/docs/master/components/service-mesh#troubleshooting-incompatible-istio-sidecar-version-after-kyma-upgrade) for more information.
