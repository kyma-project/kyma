# Migrate from 1.19 to 1.20

## Fluent Bit

Kyma 1.20 comes with a redesigned configuration for Fluent Bit. It is redesigned to be up-to-date with the upstream chart and also be consistent with the rest of the configuration values. The latest configurations can be found [in the chart](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/blob/master/resources/logging/charts/fluent-bit/values.yaml#L134). If you have been using overrides for Fluent Bit, you will need to compare them with the latest configurations and adapt if necessary. It also now supports many more configuration options for the plugins coming out-of-the-box. For example, you can set the `alias` field for all the input and output plugins to be used as the parent name for the metric. You can read more about it [here](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/administration/monitoring#configuring-aliases).  

We also provide a way to keep the sensitive information such as credentials for an output plugin to be deployed inside a Secret instead of ending up in a ConfigMap on the cluster. You can pass the secret values as key/value pairs [here](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/blob/master/resources/logging/charts/fluent-bit/values.yaml#L135) and they will be populated to the Fluent Bit Pods as environment variables mounted from a Secret. Then, you can use the environment variable in the Fluent Bit configuration. We strongly recommend moving all the sensitive information in your configuration to this new field as they will be kept more secure in a Secret.

We have also included many [parsers](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/blob/master/resources/logging/charts/fluent-bit/templates/kyma-additions/_parsers.tpl) coming out-of-the-box with Fluent Bit. You can use the parsers by specifying a [parser filter](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/filters/parser) for your workload or by annotating the Pods as explained in [here](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/filters/kubernetes#suggest-a-parser).
