# Migrate from 1.15 to 1.16

## Istio

Kyma 1.16 comes with a new Istio version: 1.5.10.

All Istio-related objects in Kyma are updated, but the migration may be necessary for the Istio objects created manually in your cluster.
Please read the [Istio upgrade notes](https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.5.x/announcing-1.5/upgrade-notes/) for the details.
Please ensure you're not using Istio RBAC, which is [deprecated](https://istio.io/v1.5/docs/reference/config/security/istio.rbac.v1alpha1/) and may not work after the upgrade. Use the [Authorization Policy](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/security/authorization-policy/) to configure authorization for your services.
In addition, consider migrating existing Authentication Policy to equivalent PeerAuthentication and RequestAuthentication objects.
