# Migrate from v1.5 to v1.6

>**TIP:** To learn more about upgrading Kyma, read [this](https://kyma-project.io/docs/master/root/kyma/#installation-upgrade-kyma) document.

## Service Management

We have migrated the Service Catalog to the CRDs in this [PR](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/service-catalog/pull/2630). To support upgrade from earlier versions, we created a migration job which migrates their Service Catalog related resources on upgrade.

In order to make a successful upgrade of Kyma, the Service Catalog resources can't be in the unfinished/deleted state. Otherwise our upgrade job can fail.

To check if your cluster is ready to migration, use the sanity check [script](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/service-catalog).

>**CAUTION:** You can safely remove the migration job PVC, which contains data about your Service Catalog resources only when the migration end up successfully.
