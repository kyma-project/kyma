# Migrate from v1.5 to v1.6

>**TIP:** To learn more about upgrading Kyma, read [this](https://kyma-project.io/docs/master/root/kyma/#installation-upgrade-kyma) document.

## Service Management

We have migrated the Service Catalog API Server to the new CRDs approach. To support upgrade from the earlier Kyma versions, we created a migration job which migrates your Service Catalog-related resources.

In order to perform the successful Kyma upgrade, you must ensure that your Service Catalog resources are not in the unfinished or deleted state. Otherwise, your upgrade job can fail.

To check if your cluster is ready for migration, use the [sanity check script](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/service-catalog/blob/b5a5c4bdb6f4bcf13171476113467feb274de1f7/contrib/hack/migration-check.sh).

>**CAUTION:** You can safely remove the migration job PVC that contains data about your Service Catalog resources **ONLY** when the migration ends up successfully.
