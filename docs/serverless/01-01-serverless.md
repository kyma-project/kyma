title: Overview

The term "serverless" refers to the Internet-based architecture. Application development that uses serverless technology relies solely on a combination of cloud-based, third-party services, client-side logic, and service-hosted remote procedure calls, also known as Functions as a Service (FaaS). Developers create this combination using [lambda functions](/components/serverless#details-managing-lambdas) which connect third-party services and Kyma,replacing the common use of a server.

Using the serverless approach reduces the implementation and operation effort to the absolute minimum.

The serverless implementation of Kyma is based on [Kubeless](https://github.com/kubeless/kubeless).
