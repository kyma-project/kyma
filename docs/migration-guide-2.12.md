In preparation for the upcoming modularization and having a reduced set of dependencies on a module, Kyma switched to an annotation-based scraping of metrics for system components. With that, the ServiceMonitors of the components must be cleaned up. When you upgrade from Kyma 2.11 to 2.12, either run the script [cleanup.sh](./assets/2.12-cleanup-servicemonitors.sh) or run the commands from the script manually.
