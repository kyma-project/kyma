Logging in Kyma uses [Loki](https://github.com/grafana/loki) which is a Prometheus-like log management system. This lightweight solution, integrated with Grafana, is easy to understand and operate. Loki provides Promtail which is a log router for Docker containers. Promtail runs inside Docker, checks each container and routes the logs to the log management system.


> **NOTE:** At the moment, Kyma provides an **alpha** version of the Logging component. The default Loki Pod log tailing configuration does not work with Kubernetes version 1.14 (for GKE version 1.12.6-gke.X) and above. For setup and preparation of deployment see the [cluster installation](/root/kyma/#installation-install-kyma-on-a-cluster) guide.

> **CAUTION:** Loki is designed for application logging. Do not log any sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers.
