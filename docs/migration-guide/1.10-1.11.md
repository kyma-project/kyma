# Migrate from v1.10 to v1.11 

## CLI

In this release, we introduced changes to the Kyma installation process to avoid potential issues during the Kyma upgrade. We ensured compliance with the recent Kyma CLI version, but using older versions results in the following error displayed during Kyma installation:

```bash 
- Kyma Installer deployed 
X Configuring Helm 
Error: jobs.batch "helm-certs-job" not found 
``` 
To ensure error-free Kyma installation, [upgrade](https://github.com/kyma-project/cli#installation) the Kyma CLI to the latest version.
