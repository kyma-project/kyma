title: Asset Store
type: Overview
---

The Asset Store is a Kubernetes-native solution for storing assets, such as documents, files, images, API specifications, and client-side applications.

This solution has a number of benefits:
- It is flexible. You can use it for storing various types of assets, such as Markdown documents, ZIP, PNG, or JS files.
- It is scalable. It allows you to store assets on a production system, using cloud provider storage services. At the same time, you can apply it to local development and use Minio to store assets on-premise.
- It is multi-cloud and not locked into one vendor. When using the Asset Store in a production system, you can seamlessly switch between different major service providers, such as AWS S3 or Azure Blob.
- It is location-independent. It allows you to expose files directly to the Internet and replicate them to different regions. This way, you can access them easily, regardless of your location.
