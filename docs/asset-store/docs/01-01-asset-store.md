title: Asset Store
type: Overview
---

Asset Store is a generic, Kubernetes-native solution for storing documentation, images, API specifications, and client-side applications.

The benefits of this solution are as follows:
- It allows for storing various kinds of assets, such as markdown documents, zip, PNG, or JavaScript (JS) files.
- It is scalable and can be used on a production system as it allows for storing assets on a large-scale using cloud provider storage services.
- It is multi-cloud and not locked into one vendor, like AWS S3, or on-premise Minio. You can seamlessly switch between different service providers depending on your current subscription.
- Having a storage solution that not only stores the files but also exposes them directly to the Internet which makes the assets easily accessible from various locations.
