Asset Store is a Kubernetes-native solution for storing assets, such as documents, files, images, API specifications, and client-side applications.

The benefits of this solution are as follows:
- You can use it for storing various kinds of assets, such as Markdown documents, Zip, PNG, or JavaScript (JS) files.
- It is flexible. It allows you to store assets on a large-scale, on a production system, using cloud provider storage services. At the same time, you can use it for local development and store assets on-premise, in Minio. 
- It is multi-cloud and not locked into one vendor, like AWS S3 or Azure Blob. You can seamlessly switch between different major service providers when using the Asset Store on a production system.
- Having a storage solution that not only stores the files but also exposes them directly to the Internet which makes the assets easily accessible from various locations.
