title: Minio sub-chart
type: Configuration
---

To configure the Minio sub-chart, override the default values of its `values.yaml` file. 

>**NOTE:** As Minio is originally an opensource Helm chart, some of its values in Kyma are already overridden in the main `values.yaml` of the Asset Store chart.

See [this document](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/minio#configuration) to find a full list of Minio configurable parameters.
