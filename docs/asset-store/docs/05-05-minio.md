title: Minio sub-chart
type: Configuration
---

To configure the Minio sub-chart, override the default values of its `values.yaml` file. 

>**TIP:** To learn more about how to use overrides in Kyma, see the following documents: 
>* [Helm overrides for Kyma installation](/root/kyma/#configuration-helm-overrides-for-kyma-installation)
>* [Sub-charts overrides](/root/kyma/#configuration-helm-overrides-for-kyma-installation-sub-chart-overrides)

>**NOTE:** As Minio is originally an opensource Helm chart, some of its values in Kyma are already overridden in the main `values.yaml` of the Asset Store chart.

See [this document](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/minio#configuration) for a full list of Minio configurable parameters.
