The `clusterassets.assetstore.kyma-project.io` CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) is a detailed description of the kind of data and the format used to define an asset to store in a cloud storage bucket. To get the up-to-date CRD and show the output in the `yaml` format, run this command:

```bash
kubectl get crd clusterassets.assetstore.kyma-project.io -o yaml
```
