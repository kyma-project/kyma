title: Function
type: Custom Resources
---

The `functions.serverless.kyma-project.io` CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) is a detailed description of the kind of data and the format used to manage Functions within Kyma. To get the up-to-date CRD and show the output in the YAML format, run this command:

```bash
kubectl get crd functions.serverless.kyma-project.io -o yaml
```

## Sample custom resource

The following Function object creates a Function which responds to HTTP requests with the "Hello John" message. The Function's code (**source**) and dependencies (**deps**) are specified in the Function CR.

```yaml
apiVersion: serverless.kyma-project.io/v1alpha1
kind: Function
metadata:
  name: my-test-function
  namespace: default
spec:
  env:
    - name: PERSON_NAME
      value: "John"
  deps: |
    {
      "name": "hellowithdeps",
      "version": "0.0.1",
      "dependencies": {
        "end-of-stream": "^1.4.1",
        "from2": "^2.3.0",
        "lodash": "^4.17.5"
      }
    }
  labels:
    app: my-test-function
  minReplicas: 3
  maxReplicas: 3
  resources:
    limits:
      cpu: 1
      memory: 1Gi
    requests:
      cpu: 500m
      memory: 500Mi
  buildResources:
    limits:
      cpu: 2
      memory: 2Gi
    requests:
      cpu: 1
      memory: 1Gi
  source: |
    module.exports = {
      main: function(event, context) {
        const name = process.env.PERSON_NAME;
        return 'Hello ' + name;
      }
    }
  runtime: nodejs12
  status:
    conditions:
      - lastTransitionTime: "2020-04-14T08:17:11Z"
        message: "Deployment my-test-function-nxjdp is ready"
        reason: DeploymentReady
        status: "True"
        type: Running
      - lastTransitionTime: "2020-04-14T08:16:55Z"
        message: "Job my-test-function-build-552ft finished"
        reason: JobFinished
        status: "True"
        type: BuildReady
      - lastTransitionTime: "2020-04-14T08:16:16Z"
        message: "ConfigMap my-test-function-xv6pc created"
        reason: ConfigMapCreated
        status: "True"
        type: ConfigurationReady
```

If you store the Function's source code and dependencies in a Git repository and want the Function Controller to fetch them from it, use these parameters in the Function CR:

```yaml
apiVersion: serverless.kyma-project.io/v1alpha1
kind: Function
metadata:
  name: my-test-function
spec:
  type: git
  source: auth-basic
  baseDir: "/"
  reference: "branchA"
  runtime: "nodejs12"
```

## Custom resource parameters

This table lists all the possible parameters of a given resource together with their descriptions:

| **spec.runtime**                         |       No       | Specifies the runtime of the Function. The available values are `nodejs12`, `python38` and `nodejs14`. It is set to `nodejs14` unless specified otherwise.  |
| **spec.type**                          |      No       | Defines that you use a Git repository as the source of Function's code and dependencies. It must be set to `git`. |
| **spec.source**                          |      Yes       | Provides the Function's full source code or the name of the Git directory in which the code and dependencies are stored.     |
| **spec.baseDir**                          |      No       | Specifies the relative path to the Git directory that contains the source code from which the Function will be builtâ€‹. |
| **spec.reference**                        |      No       | Specifies either the branch name or the commit revision from which the Function Controller automatically fetches the changes in Function's code and dependencies. |
| **status.conditions.lastTransitionTime** | Not applicable | Provides a timestamp for the last time the Function's condition status changed from one to another.    |
| **status.conditions.message**            | Not applicable | Describes a human-readable message on the CR processing progress, success, or failure.   |
| **status.conditions.reason**             | Not applicable | Provides information on the Function CR processing success or failure. See the [**Reasons**](#status-reasons) section for the full list of possible status reasons and their descriptions. All status reasons are in camelCase.   |
| **status.conditions.status**             | Not applicable | Describes the status of processing the Function CR by the Function Controller. It can be `True` for success, `False` for failure, or `Unknown` if the CR processing is still in progress. If the status of all conditions is `True`, the overall status of the Function CR is ready.     |
| **status.conditions.type**               | Not applicable | Describes a substage of the Function CR processing. There are three condition types that a Function has to meet to be ready: `ConfigurationReady`, `BuildReady`, and `Running`. When displaying the Function status in the terminal, these types are shown under `CONFIGURED`, `BUILT`, and `RUNNING` columns respectively. All condition types can change asynchronously depending on the type of Function modification, but all three need to be in the `True` status for the Function to be considered successfully processed. |

### Status reasons

Processing of a Function CR can succeed, continue, or fail for one of these reasons:

| Reason                           | Type                 | Description                                                                                                                                                   |
