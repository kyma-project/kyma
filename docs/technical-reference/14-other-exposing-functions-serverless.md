title: Exposing Functions
---

To access a Function within the cluster, use the `{function-name}.{namespace}.svc.cluster.local` endpoint, such as `test-function.default.svc.cluster.local`. To expose a Function outside the cluster, you must create an [APIRule custom resource (CR)](/components/api-gateway#custom-resource-api-rule):

1. Create the APIRule CR where you specify the Function to expose, define an [Oathkeeper Access Rule](/components/api-gateway/#details-available-security-options) to secure it, and list which HTTP request methods you want to enable for it.

1. The API Gateway Controller detects a new APIRule CR and reads its definition.

1. The API Gateway Controller creates an Istio Virtual Service and Access Rules according to details specified in the CR. Such a Function service is available under the `{host-name}.{domain}` endpoint, such as `my-function.kyma.local`.

This way you can specify multiple APIRules with different authentication methods for a single Function service.

>**TIP:** See the [tutorial](#tutorials-expose-a-function-with-an-api-rule) for a detailed example.

>**NOTE:** If you are using Minikube, before you can access the function you must add the endpoint to the Minikube IP entry in the `/etc/hosts` file.
