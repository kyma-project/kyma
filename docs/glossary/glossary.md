Here's a list of the most commonly used terms:

| Kyma Cluster        | A Kubernetes cluster                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |       |
| Function            | A simple code snippet that you can run without provisioning or managing servers. It implements the exact business logic you define. A Function is based on the Function custom resource and can be written in either Node.js or Python. A Function can perform a business logic of its own. You can also bind it to an instance of a service and configure it to be triggered whenever it receives a particular event type from the service or a call is made to the service's API. |       |
| Microservice        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |       |
| Role                | Access to every cluster is managed by the roles assigned. Roles give the assigned users a different level of permissions suitable for different purposes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |       |
| Namespace           | Namespaces organize objects in a cluster and provide a way to divide cluster resources. This way, several users can share a cluster but have access only to resources within the Namespace they have permissions for. This increases the security and organization of your cluster by dividing it into smaller units. Access to Namespaces in the Kyma environment depends on your permissions.                                                                                     |       |
| Busola              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |       |
| Credentials/Secrets | Sensitive data to call the service, connect to it, and authenticate it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |       |
