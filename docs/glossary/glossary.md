| Kyma Cluster        | A Kubernetes cluster with Kyma installed. A cluster is a set of worker machines, called nodes, that run containerized applications. Every cluster has at least one worker node.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [Kubernetes Components](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/) |
| Function            | A simple code snippet that you can run without provisioning or managing servers. It implements the exact business logic you define. A Function is based on the Function custom resource and can be written in either Node.js or Python. A Function can perform a business logic of its own. You can also bind it to an instance of a service and configure it to be triggered whenever it receives a particular event type from the service or a call is made to the service's API. Functions are executed only if they are triggered by an event or an API call. |       |
| Microservice        | An architectural variant for extensions or applications, where you separate the tasks in smaller pieces that interact with each other as loosely coupled, independently deployable units of code. A failing microservice should not cause your whole application to fail. Microservices are packed in a container that is always running; it's idling if there is no load. The microservice should always be reachable even when the pods move around. Microservices typically communicate through APIs.                                                                                                                                                                   |       |
| Role                | Access to every cluster is managed by the roles assigned. Roles give the assigned users a different level of permissions suitable for different purposes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |       |
| Namespace           | Namespaces organize objects in a cluster and provide a way to divide cluster resources. This way, several users can share a cluster but have access only to resources within the Namespace they have permissions for. This increases the security and organization of your cluster by dividing it into smaller units. Access to Namespaces in the Kyma environment depends on your permissions.                                                                                     | [Kubernetes Namespaces](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/) |
| Busola              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |       |
| Credentials/Secrets | Sensitive data to call the service, connect to it, and authenticate it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |       |
