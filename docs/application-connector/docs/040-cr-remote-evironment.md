title: RemoteEnvironment
type: Custom Resource
---

The `remoteenvironments.remoteenvironment.kyma.cx` Custom Resource Definition (CRD) is a detailed description of the kind of data and the format used to register a Remote Environment in Kyma. The RemoteEnvironment resource defines APIs that the Remote Environment offers. As a result, the RemoteEnvironment is mapped to ServiceClasses in the Service Catalog. To get the up-to-date CRD and show the output in the `yaml` format, run this command:

```
kubectl get crd remoteenvironments.remoteenvironment.kyma.cx -o yaml
```
