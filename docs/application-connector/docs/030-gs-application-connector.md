title: Run Application Connector on Minikube
type: Getting Started
---

This Getting Started guide shows you how to run a new Application Connector on Minikube.

To integrate a new Remote Environment marked as `Production`, you can use the following values:
* **sourceEnvironment** = `production`
* **sourceType** = `marketing`
* **sourceNamespace** = `organization.com`

Start with:

``` bash
helm install --name hmc-prod --set deployment.args.sourceType=marketing --set deployment.args.sourceEnvironment=production --set global.isLocalEnv=true --set service.externalapi.nodePort=32002 --namespace kyma-integration ./remote-environments
```

Your output looks like this:
``` bash
NAME:   hmc-prod
