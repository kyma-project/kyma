title: Application
type: Custom Resource
---

The `applications.applicationconnector.kyma-project.io` CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) is a detailed description of the kind of data and the format used to register an Application in Kyma. The `Application` custom resource (CR) defines the APIs that the Application offers. After creating a new custom resource for a given Application, the Application is mapped to appropriate ServiceClasses in the Service Catalog. To get the up-to-date CRD and show the output in the `yaml` format, run this command:

```bash
kubectl get crd applications.applicationconnector.kyma-project.io -o yaml
```

## Sample custom resource

This is a sample resource that registers the `system-prod` Application which offers one service.

>**NOTE:** The name of the Application must consist of lower case alphanumeric characters, `-` or `.`, and start and end with an alphanumeric character.

```yaml
apiVersion: applicationconnector.kyma-project.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: system-prod
spec:
  description: This is the system-production Application.
  labels:
    region: us
    kind: production
```
