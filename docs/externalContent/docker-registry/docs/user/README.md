# Docker Registry Module

## What is the Docker Registry Module?

> [!WARNING]  
> Do not use Docker Registry in production clusters, where a full-fledged, highly-available, production-grade registry is necessary.

The Docker Registry module is a Kubernetes operator that adds the Docker Registry capability to a Kubernetes cluster. It installs packaged distribution images and configures them to be easily used in Kyma runtime.

## What is Docker Registry in Kyma?

Docker Registry brings extra capability to Kyma runtime, which is useful in the development phase. It allows developers to push their images into Kymaâ€™s internal registry and use the images to spin workloads in the same cluster.
