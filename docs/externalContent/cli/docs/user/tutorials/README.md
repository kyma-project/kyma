# Tutorials

This section will help you understand Kyma CLI and how to use it in different scenarios.

> [!TIP]
> Before you use Kyma CLI, we strongly recommend adding the autocomplete formula to your shell (`bash`, `fish`, `PowerShell`, or `zsh`).
> Run the following command to import the Kyma CLI autocomplete formula for the `zsh` shell and enable autocomplete with the tab key hit:
> `source <(kyma completion zsh)`
