# ApplicationConnector

The `applicationconnectors.operator.kyma-project.io` CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) is a comprehensive specification that defines the structure and format used to manage the configuration and status of the Application Connector module within your Kyma environment.

## Purpose

The CRD serves as the blueprint for creating custom resources (CRs) specific to Application Connector. These CRs encapsulate the configuration settings and real-time statuses of the Application Connector module, providing essential insights into the module's behavior in the Kubernetes cluster.

To get the up-to-date CRD and show the output in the `yaml` format, run this command:

   ```bash
   kubectl get crd applicationconnectors.operator.kyma-project.io -o yaml
   ```

## Custom Resource Specification

| Path | Description | Required |
| ---- | ----------- | -------- |
| domainName | The domain name used by the virtual service and gateway resources. On the Gardener cluster, this field is autopopulated. | false |
| appConnValidator.logLevel | Determines the level of verbosity or detail for logging messages generated by Application Connectivity Validator; one of `debug`, `panic`, `fatal`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug` | false |
| appConnValidator.logFormat | Allows for specifying the format in which Application Connectivity Validator generates log messages; one of: `json`, `text`  | false |
| appGateway.logLevel | Determines the level of verbosity or detail for logging messages generated by Application Gateway; one of `debug`, `panic`, `fatal`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug` | false |
| appGateway.proxyTimeout | Specifies the maximum duration for which Application Gateway waits for a response from an external system before timing out | false |
| appGateway.requestTimeout | Specifies the maximum duration for which Application Gateway waits for a response from a client request before timing out. | false |

## Sample Custom Resource

   ```bash
   apiVersion: operator.kyma-project.io/v1alpha1
   kind: ApplicationConnector
   metadata:
     namespace: kyma-system
     labels:
       app.kubernetes.io/name: applicationconnector
       app.kubernetes.io/instance: applicationconnector-sample
     name: applicationconnector-sample
   spec:
     domainName: "my.domain"
     appConnValidator:
       logLevel: "info"
       logFormat: "json"
     appGateway:
       proxyTimeout: "10s"
       requestTimeout: "10s"
