# APIRule Custom Resource <!-- {docsify-ignore-all} -->

The `apirules.gateway.kyma-project.io` CRD describes the kind and the format of data the APIRule Controller uses to configure resources.

> [!WARNING]
> APIRule CRDs in versions `v1beta1` and `v2alpha1` have been deprecated and will be removed in upcoming releases.
>
> After careful consideration, we have decided that the deletion of `v1beta1` planned for end of May will be postponed. A new target date will be announced in the future.
> 
> **Required action**: Migrate all your APIRule custom resources (CRs) to version `v2`.
> 
> To migrate your APIRule CRs from version `v2alpha1` to version `v2`, you must update the version in APIRule CRsâ€™ metadata.
> 
> To learn how to migrate your APIRule CRs from version `v1beta1` to version `v2`, see [APIRule Migration](../../apirule-migration/README.md).
> 
> Since the APIRule CRD `v2alpha1` is identical to `v2`, the migration procedure from version `v1beta1` to version `v2` is the same as from version `v1beta1` to version `v2alpha1`.
