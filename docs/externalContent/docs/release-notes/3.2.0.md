## APIRule v1beta1 Deletion

Version 3.2.0 of the API Gateway module introduces the first step in the process of deleting APIRule `v1beta1`. Now, Kyma dashboard does not display APIRule custom resources (CRs) in version `v1beta1`. All APIRules `v1beta1` are fully operational from the command line, and you are still able to manage them using kubectl. Additionally, this change does not affect any pipelines that manage APIRules using Kubernetes utilities such as kubectl or helm.

**Required action**: You must migrate all your APIRules to version `v2`. For more information, see [APIRule Migration](../user/apirule-migration/). We strongly recommend starting the migration as soon as possible to avoid any disruptions.

## Bug Fixes
- We've fixed conversion from APIRule `v1beta1` to `v2`. The conversion now sets all convertible fields in the APIRule's **spec**. [#1983](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/issues/1983)
