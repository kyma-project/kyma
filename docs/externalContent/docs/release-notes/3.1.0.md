Release 3.1.0 of the API Gateway module changes the stored version of APIRule to `v2alpha1`. This change is part of the migration process towards the `v2` version, which will eventually result in removing the `v1beta1` version. #1777
## Bug Fixes

- Fix behaviour of in-cluster connectivity when using JWT handler in APIRule. Now, in-cluster connectivity is blocked. [#1823](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/pull/1823)
- Fix the `extAuth` handler not being scoped to a particular host. [#1901](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/pull/1901)
- Fix reconciliation of convertible APIRules. [#1924](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/pull/1924)
- When converting APIRule to version `v2`, the `original-version` annotation is not set if it's already present in the APIRule. [#1921](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/pull/1921)
- The order of rules in the APIRule Custom Resource is important. Rules defined earlier in the list have a higher priority than those defined later. For more information, see [Significance of Rule Path Order](https://kyma-project.io/#/api-gateway/user/custom-resources/apigateway/04-00-apigateway-custom-resource?id=significance-of-rule-path-order).
