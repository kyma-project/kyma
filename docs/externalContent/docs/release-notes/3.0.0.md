Release 3.0.0 of the API Gateway module introduces APIRule CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) in the stable version `v2` based on Istio.

The new CRD allows you to expose your workloads using one of the three supported access strategies: **jwt**, **noAuth**, and **extAuth**. The **noAuth** access strategy provides a simple configuration for exposing workloads over the specified HTTP methods. The **jwt** access strategy allows you to secure your workload by defining Istio JWT configuration and the **extAuth** access strategy allows for providing custom authentication and authorization logic.

## Migration Timeline for SAP BTP, Kyma Runtime

The API Gateway module in version 3.0.0 is scheduled to be rolled out to the fast channel on March 5, 2025, and to the regular channel on April 15, 2025.

APIRule CR in version `v1beta1` has been deprecated and will be removed on May 12, 2025. Version `v2alpha1`, introduced for testing purposes, becomes deprecated on April 15, 2025, and is scheduled to be removed on June 16, 2025. For more information, see [APIRule migration - timelines](https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/sap-btp-kyma-runtime-apirule-migration-timelines/ba-p/13995712).

## Migration Procedure

You must migrate all your APIRules to version `v2`. 

To migrate APIRules from version `v2alpha1` to version `v2`, update the version in your APIRule CRsâ€™ metadata.

To migrate APIRules from version `v1beta1` to `v2`, follow the procedure described in the blog posts [APIRule migration - noAuth and jwt handlers](https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/sap-btp-kyma-runtime-apirule-migration-noauth-and-jwt-handlers/ba-p/13882833) and [APIRule migration - Ory Oathkeeper based OAuth2 handlers](https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/sap-btp-kyma-runtime-apirule-migration-ory-oathkeeper-based-oauth2-handlers/ba-p/13896184). See [Changes Introduced in APIRule v2](https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/changes-introduced-in-apirule-v2alpha1-and-v2/ba-p/14029529). Since the APIRule CRD `v2alpha1` is identical to `v2`, the migration procedure from version `v1beta1` to version `v2` is the same as from from version `v1beta1` to version `v2alpha1`.
