# Expose a Workload with Short Host Name

Learn how to expose an unsecured Service instance using a short host name instead of the full domain name. 

> [!WARNING]
>  Exposing a workload to the outside world is a potential security vulnerability, so be careful. In a production environment, always secure the workload you expose with [JWT](../01-50-expose-and-secure-a-workload/01-52-expose-and-secure-workload-jwt.md).

## Prerequisites

* You have the Istio and API Gateway modules added.
* You have a deployed workload.
  > [!NOTE] 
  > To expose a workload using APIRule in version `v2`, the workload must be a part of the Istio service mesh. See [Enable Istio Sidecar Proxy Injection](https://kyma-project.io/#/istio/user/tutorials/01-40-enable-sidecar-injection?id=enable-istio-sidecar-proxy-injection).
* To use CLI instructions, you must install [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) and [curl](https://curl.se/). Alternatively, you can use Kyma dashboard.
* You have [set up your custom domain](../01-10-setup-custom-domain-for-workload.md). Alternatively, you can use the default domain of your Kyma cluster and the default Gateway `kyma-system/kyma-gateway`.
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > Because the default Kyma domain is a wildcard domain, which uses a simple TLS Gateway, it is recommended that you set up your custom domain for use in a production environment.

  > [!TIP]
  > To learn what the default domain of your Kyma cluster is, run `kubectl get gateway -n kyma-system kyma-gateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.servers[0].hosts}'`.

## Context
Using a short host makes it simpler to apply APIRules because the domain name is automatically retrieved from the referenced Gateway, and you donâ€™t have to manually set it in each APIRule. This might be particularly useful when reconfiguring resources in a new cluster, as it reduces the chance of errors and streamlines the process. The referenced Gateway must provide the same single host for all [Server](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/gateway/#Server) definitions, and it must be prefixed with `*.`.

## Steps

### Expose Your Workload
To expose your workload using a short host, replace placeholders and create the following APIRule CR. You can adjust the configuration, if needed.

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: gateway.kyma-project.io/v2alpha1
kind: APIRule
metadata:
  name: {APIRULE_NAME}
  namespace: {APIRULE_NAMESPACE}
spec:
  hosts:
    - {SUBDOMAIN}
  service:
    name: {SERVICE_NAME}
    namespace: {SERVICE_NAMESPACE}
    port: {SERVICE_PORT}
  gateway: {NAMESPACE/GATEWAY}
  rules:
    - path: /*
      methods: ["GET"]
      noAuth: true
    - path: /post
      methods: ["POST"]
      noAuth: true
EOF
```

### Access Your Workload

- Replace the placeholder and send a `GET` request to the service.

  ```bash
  curl -ik -X GET https://{SUBDOMAIN}.{DOMAIN_NAME}/ip
  ```
  If successful, the call returns the `200 OK` response code.

- Replace the placeholder and send a `POST` request to the service.

  ```bash
  curl -ik -X POST https://{SUBDOMAIN}.{DOMAIN_NAME}/post -d "test data"
  ```
  If successful, the call returns the `200 OK` response code.
