The troubleshooting section aims to identify the most common recurring problems the users face when they expose APIs, as well as the most suitable solutions to these problems.

If you can't find a solution, don't hesitate to create a [GitHub](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/issues) issue or reach out to our [Slack channel](https://kyma-community.slack.com/) to get direct support from the community.
