# APIRule v2alpha1 Custom Resource <!-- {docsify-ignore-all} -->

> [!WARNING]
> APIRule CRDs in versions `v1beta1` and `v2alpha1` have been deprecated and will be removed in upcoming releases.
>
> After careful consideration, we have decided that the deletion of `v1beta1` planned for end of May will be postponed. A new target date will be announced in the future.
> 
> **Required action**: Migrate all your APIRule custom resources (CRs) to version `v2`.
> 
> To migrate your APIRule CRs from version `v2alpha1` to version `v2`, you must update the version in APIRule CRsâ€™ metadata.
> 
> To learn how to migrate your APIRule CRs from version `v1beta1` to version `v2`, see [APIRule Migration](../../../apirule-migration/README.md).
> 
> Since the APIRule CRD `v2alpha1` is identical to `v2`, the migration procedure from version `v1beta1` to version `v2` is the same as from version `v1beta1` to version `v2alpha1`.

The `apirules.gateway.kyma-project.io` CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) describes the kind and the format of data the
APIGateway Controller listens for. To get the up-to-date CRD in the `yaml` format, run the following command:

```shell
kubectl get crd apirules.gateway.kyma-project.io -o yaml

> [!WARNING]
> When you use an unsupported `v1beta1` configuration in version `v2alpha1` of the APIRule CR, you get an empty **spec**. See [supported access strategies](04-15-api-rule-access-strategies.md).

> [!WARNING]
> The Ory handler is not supported in version `v2alpha1` of the APIRule. When **noAuth** is set to true, **jwt** cannot be defined on the same path.

> [!WARNING]
>  If a service is not defined at the **spec.service** level, all defined Access Rules must have it defined at the **spec.rules.service** level. Otherwise, the validation fails.

> [!WARNING]
>  If a short host name is defined at the **spec.hosts** level, the referenced Gateway must provide the same single host for all [Server](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/gateway/#Server) definitions and it must be prefixed with `*.`. Otherwise, the validation fails.

**Status:**

The following table lists the fields of the **status** section.

| Field                  | Description                                                                                                                       |
|:-----------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **status.state**       | Defines the reconciliation state of the APIRule. The possible states are `Ready`, `Warning`, `Error`, `Processing`, or `Deleting`. |
| **status.description** | Contains a detailed description of **status.state**.                                                                                         |

### Significance of Rules Path Order
Operators `{*}` and `{**}` allow you to define a single APIRule that matches multiple request paths.
However, this also introduces the possibility of path conflicts.
A path conflict occurs when two or more APIRule resources match the same path and share at least one common HTTP method. This is why the order of rules is important.

Rules defined earlier in the list have a higher priority than those defined later. Therefore, we recommend defining rules from the most specific path to the most general.

See an example of a valid **rules.path** order, listed from the most specific to the most general:
- `/anything/one`
- `/anything/one/two`
- `/anything/{*}/one`
- `/anything/{*}/one/{**}/two`
- `/anything/{*}/{*}/two`
- `/anything/{**}/two`
- `/anything/`
- `/anything/{**}`
- `/{**}`

Understanding the relationship between paths and methods in a rule is crucial to avoid unexpected behavior. For example, the following APIRule configuration excludes the `POST` and `GET` methods for the path `/anything/one` with `noAuth`. This happens because the rule with the path `/anything/{**}` shares at least one common method (`GET`) with a preceding rule.

```yaml
...
rules:
  - methods:
    - GET
    jwt:
      authentications:
        - issuer: https://example.com
          jwksUri: https://example.com/.well-known/jwks.json
    path: /anything/one
  - methods:
    - GET
    - POST
    noAuth: true
    path: /anything/{**}
```
To use the `POST` method on the path `/anything/one`, you must define separate rules for overlapping methods and paths. See the following example:
```yaml
...
rules:
  - methods:
      - GET
    jwt:
      authentications:
        - issuer: https://example.com
          jwksUri: https://example.com/.well-known/jwks.json
    path: /anything/one
  - methods:
      - GET
    noAuth: true
    path: /anything/{**}
  - methods:
      - POST
    noAuth: true
    path: /anything/{**}
```

|:------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   `Ready`    | APIRule Controller finished reconciliation.                                                                                                                                                                                 |

|   `Error`    | An error occurred during the reconciliation. The error is rather related to the API Gateway module than the configuration of your resources.                                                                        |
|  `Warning`   | An issue occurred during the reconciliation that requires your attention. Check the status.description message to identify the issue and make the necessary corrections to the APIRule CR or any related resources. |

## Sample Custom Resource

See an exemplary APIRule custom resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.kyma-project.io/v2alpha1
kind: APIRule
metadata:
  name: service-exposed
spec:
  gateway: kyma-system/kyma-gateway
  hosts:
    - foo.bar
  service:
    name: foo-service
    namespace: foo-namespace
    port: 8080
  timeout: 360
  rules:
    - path: /*
      methods: [ "GET" ]
      noAuth: true
```

This sample APIRule illustrates the usage of a short host name. It uses the domain from the referenced Gateway `kyma-system/kyma-gateway`:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.kyma-project.io/v2alpha1
kind: APIRule
metadata:
  name: service-exposed
spec:
  gateway: kyma-system/kyma-gateway
  hosts:
    - foo
  service:
    name: foo-service
    namespace: foo-namespace
    port: 8080
  timeout: 360
  rules:
    - path: /*
      methods: [ "GET" ]
      noAuth: true
```
