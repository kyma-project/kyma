# APIGateway Oathkeeper

When you create the API Gateway custom resource, Ory Oathkeeper is automatically installed as a dependency. It is necessary to provide support for API Rules that use `accessStrategies` of types other than `allow` and `no_auth`.

## Ory Oathkeeper Configuration

See the [resource configuration of Ory Oathkeeper](../../technical-reference/05-50-ory-limitations.md).
