# Troubleshooting

The troubleshooting section aims to identify the most common recurring problems the users face when they use the Istio module, as well as the most suitable solutions to these problems. See also [Troubleshooting Istio](https://github.com/istio/istio/wiki/Troubleshooting-Istio).

If you can't find a solution, check for open issues in the [Istio GitHub repository](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/issues). If none of them addresses your problem, create a new one. You can also reach out to our [Slack channel](https://kyma-community.slack.com/) to get direct support from the community.
