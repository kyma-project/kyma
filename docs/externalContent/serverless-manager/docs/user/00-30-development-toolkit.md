# Development Toolkit

To start developing your first Functions, you need:

- Self-hosted **Kubernetes cluster** and the **KUBECONFIG** file to authenticate to the cluster
- **Kyma** as the platform for managing the Function-related workloads
- [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/) as the container runtime
- [**kubectl**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/kubectl/), the Kubernetes command-line tool, for running commands against clusters
- Development environment of your choice:
  - **Kyma CLI** to easily initiate inline Functions or Git Functions locally, run, test, and later apply them in the clusters
  - **Node.js** or **Python**
  - **IDE** as the source code editor
  - **Kyma dashboard** to manage Functions and related workloads through the graphical user interface
