title: Runtime Agent connection to Compass
type: Configuration
---

One of Runtime Agent's responsibilities is establishing a trusted connection between the Kyma Runtime and Compass. This document explains how to configure this connection. 

### Initializing connection 

Runtime Agent connects to Compass using a one-time token from the Connector and exchanges it for a certificate, which is later used to fetch Applications from the Director. 

The initial connection requires the following parameteres:

| **Parameter** | **Description** | **Example value** |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **CONNECTOR_URL** | Connector URL | `https://compass-gateway.kyma.local/connector/graphql` |
| **RUNTIME_ID** | ID of the Runtime registered in the Director | `1ae04041-17e5-478f-91f8-3a2ddc7700de` |
| **TENANT** | Tenant ID  | - |
| **TOKEN** | One-time token generated for the Runtime | - |

Runtime Agent reads this configuration from the Config Map specified in the Runtime Agent Deployment (`compass-agent-configuration` by default).

To create the Config Map, run:
```
cat <<EOF | kubectl -n compass-system apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
data:
  CONNECTOR_URL: {COMPASS_CONNECTOR_URL}
  RUNTIME_ID: {RUNTIME_ID}
  TENANT: {TENANT_ID}
  TOKEN: {ONE_TIME_TOKEN}
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: compass-agent-configuration
  namespace: compass-system
EOF
```

### Connection status

Connection status is preserved in the CompassConnection Custom Resource (CR).

The CompassConnection CR contains the following Compass URLs:
- `connectorUrl` - the URL of the Connector used for maintaining secure connection.
- `directorUrl` - the URL of the Director used for fetching Applications.

The CompassConnection CR statuses contain the following fields:

|                       |                                                           |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **`connectionStatus`** |                                                          |
| `certificateStatus`   | Date of when the certificate was issued and when it expires |
| `established`         | Date of when the connection was established               |
| `lastSuccess`         | Last successful synchronization with the Connector        |
| `lastSync`            | Last synchronization attempt                              |
| `renewed`             | Last time the certificate was renewed                     |
| **`synchronizationStatus`** |                                                     |
| `lastAttempt`         | Last synchronization attempt with the Director                |
| `lastSuccessfulFetch` | Last successful fetch of resources from the Director         |
| `lastSuccessfulApplication` | Last succesful application of resources fetched from Compass |

### Reconnecting Runtime Agent

If the connection with Compass fails, Runtime Agent will keep trying to connect with the token from the Config Map. If the connection is established successfully, Runtime Agent will ignore the Config Map until the connection is lost. 

To force Runtime Agent to reconnect using the parameters from the Config Map, delete the Compass Connection CR:

```
kubectl delete compassconnection compass-connection
```
