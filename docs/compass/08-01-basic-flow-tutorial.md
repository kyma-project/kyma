title: Manage your Applications using Kyma Console and Compass UIs
type: Tutorials
---

This tutorial presents the basic flow in which you manually register an external Application's API into Compass and expose it into the Kyma Runtime. In the Kyma Runtime, you then create a function that calls the Application's API. While going through this tutorial, you will navigate between two UI views:

- Compass UI, where you create connections between Applications, Runtimes, and scenarios
- Kyma Console UI, where you manage resources used in your Application, such as services, functions, and bindings

## Prerequisites

For simplicity reasons, use the available Order Service as the sample external Application for this tutorial. Prepare the following:

- [`order-service`](./assets/order-service.yaml) file that contains the service definition, deployment, and its API
- [API specification](./assets/order-service-api-spec.yaml) of `order-service`
- [Function](./assets/function.yaml) that calls `order-service` for orders
- Kyma cluster with the Compass module and the API Packages feature enabled

>**NOTE:** Read [this](#installation-enable-compass-in-kyma-default-kyma-installation) document to learn how to install Kyma with the Compass module and the API Packages feature.

## Steps

### Deploy the external Application

1. Log in to the Kyma Console and create a new Namespace by selecting the **Add new namespace** button.

2. In the **Overview** tab in your Namespace, select the **Deploy new resource** button and use the [`order-service`](./assets/order-service.yaml) file to connect the Application.

3. In the **APIs** tab, copy the URL to your Application. You will use it in the Compass UI in the next steps.

### Register your Application in the Compass UI

1. Open a separate tab in your browser and go to `https://compass.{CLUSTER_DOMAIN}`. It will navigate you to the Compass UI. From the drop-down list on the top navigation panel, select a tenant you want to work on. For the purpose of this tutorial, select the `default` tenant. In the **Runtimes** tab, there is already the default `kymaruntime` that you can work on to complete this tutorial. Make sure that your Runtime is assigned to the `DEFAULT` scenario.

2. In the left navigation panel, navigate to the **Application** tab and click **Create application...** to register your Application in Compass. Choose **From scratch** from the drop-down list. For the purpose of this tutorial, name your Application `test-app`. By default, your Application is assigned to the `DEFAULT` scenario.

3. Select `test-app` in the **Applications** view and add the API spec of the Order Service:

    a. Click the **+** button in the **Packages** section and fill in all the required fields. For the purpose of this tutorial, name your Package `test-package`.

    b. In the **Credentials** tab, choose `None` from the drop-down list to select the credentials type. For the purpose of this tutorial, there is no need to secure the connection. Click **Create**.

    c. Navigate to the `test-package` Package and click the **+** button in the **API Definitions** section. Fill in all the required fields. In the **Target URL** field, paste the URL to your Application.

    d. Click the **Add specification** button and upload the `order-service` [API spec file](./assets/order-service-api-spec.yaml). Click **Create**.


### Use your Application in the Kyma Console UI

1. Go back to the Kyma Console UI. You can see that the `test-app` Application is registered in the **Applications** view. Select `test-app` and bind it to your Namespace by selecting the **Create Binding** button.

2. From the drop-down list in the top-right corner, select your Namespace and go to the **Catalog** view. You will see your services available under the **Services** tab. Provision the ServiceInstance by choosing your Package and clicking the **Add** button in the top-right corner of the page.

3. Create a function. In the **Overview** tab, click the **Deploy new resource** button and upload the file with the [function](./assets/function.yaml).

4. Expose your function following [this](/components/serverless/#tutorials-expose-a-function-with-an-api-rule) tutorial. Follow the instructions in the `Console UI` tab.

5. Bind the ServiceInstance to your function following [this](/components/serverless/#tutorials-bind-a-service-instance-to-a-function) tutorial. Follow the instructions in the `Console UI` tab.

### Cleanup

Clean up your cluster after going through this tutorial. To do so, delete your resources in the following order:

1. Go to the **Functions** tab and delete the `call-order-service` function.

2. Go to the **Services** tab and delete `order-service`.

3. Go to the **Deployments** tab and delete the `order-service` deployment.

4. Go to the **API Rules** tab and delete the created API Rule.

5. Go to the **Instances** tab, navigate to **Services**, and deprovision your instance by selecting the trash bin icon.

6. Go to the **Overview** section and unbind `test-app` from your Namespace.

7. Go back to the Namespaces view and delete your Namespace.

8. In the Compass UI, remove `test-app` from the **Applications** view. If you go back to the **Applications** view in the Kyma Console UI, you can see that the `test-app` Application is removed. It can take a moment, so refresh the Console UI if the Application is still there.
