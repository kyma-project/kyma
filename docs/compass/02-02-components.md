Compass consists of a set of components that allow you to extend, customize, and integrate your applications:

![Components](./assets/components.svg)

## Cockpit

Cockpit is a UI that calls Compass APIs. This component is interchangeable.

## Gateway

Gateway proxies the tenant's incoming requests to the Director component. All communication, whether it comes from an application or other external components, flows through Gateway.

## Connector

Connector establishes trust between applications and Runtimes. Currently, only client certificates are supported.

## Director

Director handles the process of registering applications and Runtimes. It also requests application webhook APIs for credentials and exposes health information about Runtimes. This component has access to the storage.

## Runtime Provisioner

Runtime Provisioner handles the creation, modification, and deletion of Runtimes. This component is interchangeable.

## Central Integration Service

Central Integration Service provides integration with Compass for the whole class of applications. It manages multiple instances of these applications. You can integrate multiple central services to support different types of applications.
