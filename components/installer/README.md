# Installer

## Overview

Kyma Installer is a tool for installing all Kyma components. The project is based on the Kubernetes operator pattern. It tracks changes of the Installation custom resource and installs, uninstalls, and updates Kyma accordingly.

## Prerequisites

- Minikube 0.26.1
- kubectl 1.9.0
- Docker
- jq

## Development

Before each commit, use the [`before-commit.sh`](./before-commit.sh) script to test your changes:
  ```
  ./before-commit.sh
  ```

## Build a Docker image

Run the [`build.sh`](./scripts/build.sh) script to build a Docker image of the Installer:
  ```
  ./scripts/build.sh
  ```

## Run on Minikube using local sources

Export the path to Kyma sources as an environment variable. This environment variable is used to trigger shell scripts located in Kyma.
  ```
  export KYMA_PATH={PATH_TO_KYMA_SOURCES}
  ```

Use this script to run Minikube, set up the Installer, and install Kyma from local sources. If Minikube was started before, it will be restarted.
  ```
  ./scripts/run.sh --local --cr {PATH_TO_CR}
  ```

See the [Custom resource file](#custom-resource-file) section in this document to learn how to generate a custom resource file.

To track progress of the installation, run:
  ```
  ../../installation/scripts/is-installed.sh
  ```

## Rerun Kyma without restarting Minikube

This scenario is useful when you want to reuse cached Docker images.

Run this script to clear running Minikube:
  ```
  ../../installation/scripts/clean-up.sh
  ```

Execute the `run.sh` script with the `--skip-minikube-start` flag to rerun Kyma installation without stopping your Minikube:
  ```
  ./scripts/run.sh --skip-minikube-start
  ```

## Update the Kyma cluster

Connect to the cluster that hosts your Kyma installation. Prepare the URL to the updated Kyma `tar.gz` package. Run the following command to edit the installation CR:
  ```
  kubectl edit installation/{CR_NAME}
  ```

Change the `url` property in **spec** to `{URL_TO KYMA_TAR_GZ}`. Trigger the update by overriding the **action** label in CR:
  ```
  kubectl label installation/{CR_NAME} action=install --overwrite
  ```

## Uninstall Kyma

Run this command to uninstall Kyma:
  ```
  kubectl label installation/kyma-installation action=uninstall
  ```

>**NOTE:** Uninstallation is an experimental feature and does not remove all resources from the cluster. Make sure to remove the remaining resources before you attempt to install Kyma again on a cluster from which it was uninstalled.  

## Custom resource file

The [Installation custom resource file](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/blob/master/docs/kyma/docs/06-01-installation.md) provides the basic information for Kyma installation.

The required properties include:

- `url` which is the URL address to a Kyma charts package. Only `tar.gz` is supported and it is required for non-local installations only.
- `version` which is the version of Kyma.
- `components` which is the list of Kyma components.

## Generate the custom resource file

Generate a custom resource file using the [`create-cr.sh`](../../installation/scripts/create-cr.sh) script. It accepts the following arguments:

- `--output` is a mandatory parameter which indicates the location of the custom resource output file.
- `--url` is the URL to the Kyma package.
- `--version` is the version of Kyma.

For example:
  ```
  ../../installation/scripts/create-cr.sh --output installer-cr.yaml --url {URL_TO_KYMA_TAR_GZ} --version 0.8.0
  ```

## Static overrides for cluster installations

You can define cluster-specific overrides for each root chart. In the cluster deployment scenario, the Installer reads the `cluster.yaml` file in each root chart and appends its content to the overrides applied during the Helm installation.
