# Overview

The Remote Environment Broker (REB) fetches all available remote environments and exposes their APIs and Events to the Service Catalog as service classes.
When the remote environments list is available in the Service Catalog, you can provision those service classes and enable Kyma services to use them.

A remote environment represents a product connected to the Kyma instance.

# Details

For more detailed information about REB, check the [docs](../../../../docs/service-brokers/docs) repository.
