# Application Gateway

## Overview

This is the repository for the Kyma Application Gateway.

## Prerequisites

The Application Gateway requires Go 1.8 or higher.

## Installation

To install the Application Gateway, follow these steps:

1. `git clone git@github.com:kyma-project/kyma.git`
2. `cd kyma/components/application-gateway`
3. `CGO_ENABLED=0 go build ./cmd/applicationgateway`

## Usage

This section explains how to use the Application Gateway.

### Start the Application Gateway

To start the Application Gateway, run this command:

```
./applicationgateway
```

The Application Gateway has the following parameters:
- **proxyPort** is the port that acts as a proxy for the calls from services and lambdas to an external solution. The default port is `8080`.
- **externalAPIPort** is the port that exposes the API allowing to check component status. The default port is `8081`.
- **application** is the Application name used to write and read information about services. The default Application is `default-ec`.
- **namespace** is the Namespace in which the Application Gateway is deployed. The default Namespace is `kyma-system`.
- **requestTimeout** is the timeout for requests sent through the Application Gateway, expressed in seconds. The default value is `1`.
- **skipVerify** is the flag for skipping the verification of certificates for the proxy targets. The default value is `false`.
- **requestLogging** is the flag for logging incoming requests. The default value is `false`.
- **proxyTimeout** is the timeout for requests sent through the proxy, expressed in seconds. The default value is `10`.
- **proxyCacheTTL** is the time to live of the remote API information stored in the proxy cache, expressed in seconds. The default value is `120`.

## Development

This section explains the development process.

### Generate mocks

To generate a mock, follow these steps:

1. Go to the directory where the interface is located.
2. Run this command:
  ```sh
  mockery -name=Sender
  ```

### Tests

This section outlines the testing details.

#### Unit tests

To run the unit tests, use the following command:

```
go test `go list ./internal/... ./cmd/...`
```
### Generate Kubernetes clients for custom resources

1. Create a directory structure for each client, similar to the one in `pkg/apis`. For example, when generating a client for EgressRule in Istio, the directory structure looks like this: `pkg/apis/istio/v1alpha2`.
2. After creating the directories, define the following files:
    - `doc.go`
    - `register.go`
    - `types.go` - define the custom structs that reflect the fields of the custom resource.

See an example in `pkg/apis/istio/v1alpha2`.

3. Go to the project root directory and run `./hack/update-codegen.sh`. The script generates a new client in `pkg/apis/client/clientset`.


### Contract between the Application Gateway and the Console Backend Service

The Console Backend Service must check the status of the Application Gateway instance that represents the Application.
In the current solution, the Console Backend Service iterates through services to find those which match the criteria, and then uses the health endpoint to determine the status.
The Console Backend Service has the following obligatory requirements:
- The Kubernetes service uses the `application` key, with the value as the name of the Application.
- The Kubernetes service contains one port with the `http-api-port` name. The system uses this port for the status check.
- Find the Kubernetes service in the `kyma-integration` Namespace. You can change its location in the `console-backend-service` chart configuration.
- The `/v1/health` endpoint returns a status of `HTTP 200`. Any other status code indicates the service is not healthy.
