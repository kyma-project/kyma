# Telemetry Operator

## Overview

The telemetry operator contains a logging controller that generates a Fluent Bit configuration from one or more `LogPipeline` custom resources. The controller ensures that all Fluent Bit Pods run the current configuration by deleting Pods after the configuration has changed. See all [CRD attributes](api/v1alpha1/logpipeline_types.go) and an [example](config/samples/telemetry_v1alpha1_logpipeline.yaml).

For now, creating Fluent Bit Pods is out of scope of the operator. An existing Fluent Bit Daemon Set is expected.

The generated Config Map (by default, `telemetry-fluent-bit-sections` in the `kyma-system` namespace) must be mounted to the Fluent Bit Pods and consumed by an `@INCLUDE` statement in an existing [configuration file](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/administration/configuring-fluent-bit/classic-mode/configuration-file). Fluent Bit parsers, file references, and environment variables are available in an additional Config Map or Secret.

See the flags that configure all Config Maps, Secret and Daemon Set names in [main.go](main.go).

The operator has been bootstrapped with [Kubebuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder) 3.1.0. Additional APIs can also be [added by Kubebuilder](https://book.kubebuilder.io/cronjob-tutorial/new-api.html).

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Install [kubebuilder 3.2.0](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder) which is the base framework for this controller
- Install [kustomize](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize) which lets you customize raw, template-free `yaml` files during local development
- Install [Golang 1.17](https://golang.org/dl/) or newer (for local execution)
- Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

### Available Commands

For development, you can use the following commands:

- Run all tests and validation

```bash
make
```

- Regenerate YAML manifests

```bash
make manifests
```

- Install CRDs to cluster in current kubeconfig context

```bash
make install-local
```

- Uninstall CRDs to cluster in current kubeconfig context

```bash
make uninstall-local
```

- Run the operator locally (uses current kubeconfig context)

```bash
make run-local
```

- Build container image and deploy to cluster in current kubeconfig context

```bash
make build-image IMG_NAME=<my container repo>
make push-image IMG_NAME=<my container repo> TAG=latest
make deploy-local IMG_NAME=<my container repo> TAG=latest
```

- Remove controller from cluster in current kubeconfig context

```bash
make undeploy-local
```
## Trying it out on a Kyma cluster
You can try out the Telemetry Operator on your Kyma cluster. Learn here how to install and configure it. When you're finished testing the Telemetry Operator, you should disable it again.
### Prerequisites

- A Kyma Cluster with the latest Kyma version installed

### Enable Telemetry Operator integration
1. Install the Telemetry Operator together with the Telemetry Fluent Bit Daemon Set with null output config: 

   ```bash
   kyma deploy --component=telemetry 
   ```

2. Configure the Telemetry Fluent Bit component to push logs to the Loki backend. Loki comes with the Kyma out of the box:

   ```bash
   kyma deploy --component logging --value global.telemetry.enabled=true
   ```

   The previous command also installs a Log Pipeline CR, which configures the Telemetry Fluent Bit to push logs to the Loki backend.

3. After disabling Fluent Bit from the logging chart, delete the unneeded resources:

   ```bash
   kubectl delete daemonset -n kyma-system logging-fluent-bit
   kubectl delete configmap -n kyma-system logging-fluent-bit
   kubectl delete servicemonitor -n kyma-system logging-fluent-bit
   ```

### Disable Telemetry Operator integration

1. To disable the Telemetry Fluent Bit integration, simply deploy the default version of the logging component, which doesn't contain the Loki Log Pipeline:

   ```bash
   kyma deploy --component logging 
   ```

2. After installing the chart, disable the Telemetry component so that it does not collect the logs anymore:

   ```bash
   kubectl delete validatingwebhookconfigurations validation.webhook.telemetry.kyma-project.io
   kubectl delete servicemonitor -n kyma-system telemetry-operator-metrics
   kubectl delete deployment -n kyma-system telemetry-operator
   kubectl delete daemonset -n kyma-system telemetry-fluent-bit
   kubectl delete service -n kyma-system telemetry-operator-webhook
   kubectl delete service -n kyma-system telemetry-operator-metrics
   kubectl delete service -n kyma-system telemetry-fluent-bit
   kubectl delete rolebinding -n kyma-system telemetry-operator-leader-election-rolebinding
   kubectl delete clusterrolebinding telemetry-operator-manager-rolebinding
   kubectl delete clusterrolebinding telemetry-fluent-bit
   kubectl delete clusterrole telemetry-operator-manager-role
   kubectl delete clusterrole logpipeline-viewer-role
   kubectl delete clusterrole logpipeline-editor-role
   kubectl delete clusterrole telemetry-fluent-bit
   kubectl delete configmap -n kyma-system telemetry-fluent-bit
   kubectl delete secret -n kyma-system telemetry-operator-webhook-cert
   kubectl delete serviceaccount -n kyma-system telemetry-operator
   kubectl delete serviceaccount -n kyma-system telemetry-fluent-bit
   ```
