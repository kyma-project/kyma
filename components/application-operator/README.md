# Application Operator packages

## Overview

The Application Operator packages consist of `pkg/apis`, `pkg/client`, and `pkg/normalization`. The first two are useful for the Application CR operations. The third one could be used to normalize the Service's name to be readable, for example, by Central Application Gateway.
