# Applications

## Overview

An Application is a representation of an external solution connected to Kyma. The Application Connector manages the traffic, connection, security, and Events of Applications. It is a proprietary implementation that consists of four services.
Read the [Application Connector documentation](../../../../docs/01-overview/02-main-areas/application-connectivity) for more details regarding the implementation.
