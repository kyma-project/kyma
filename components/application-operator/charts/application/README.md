# Applications

## Overview

An Application is a representation of an external solution connected to Kyma. The Application Connector manages the traffic, connection, security, and Events of Applications. It is a proprietary implementation that consists of four services.
Read the [Application Connector documentation](../../../../docs/application-connector/docs/01-01-application-connector.md) for more details regarding the implementation.

## Details

This directory contains the Application Helm chart that installs all components required to access Application Connector's services in the context of the created Application.
