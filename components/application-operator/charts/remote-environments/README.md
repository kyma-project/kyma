# Remote Environments

## Overview

A Remote Environment (RE) is a representation of an external solution connected to Kyma. The Application Connector manages the traffic, connection, security, and Events of REs. It is a proprietary implementation that consists of four services.
Read the [Application Connector documentation](../../../../docs/application-connector/docs/001-overview-application-connector.md) for more details regarding the implementation.

## Details

This directory contains the Remote Environment Helm chart that installs all components required to access Application Connector's services in the context of the created RE.
