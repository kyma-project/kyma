# Busola Migrator

## Overview

Busola Migrator is an HTTP server that serves a static webpage. It allows for migrating business user permissions from the SAP authentication and authorization service (XSUAA) to in-cluster roles. It also redirects the users that try to access the Console UI from the previous Kyma Console link to the new Busola URL.

## Prerequisites

To set up the project, download these tools:

* [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) v1.15 or higher
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) in the newest version

## Usage

To work correctly, the component requires a running Kubernetes cluster.
Before running the program, make sure your active Kubeconfig is pointing at the correct cluster.
