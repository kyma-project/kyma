# Components

## Overview

The `components` directory contains the sources of all Kyma components.
A Kyma component is any Pod, container, or image deployed with and referenced in a Kyma module or chart to provide the module's functionality.
Each subdirectory in the `components` directory defines one component.

## Details

Every Kyma component resides in a dedicated folder which contains its sources and a `README.md` file. This file provides instructions on how to build and develop the component.

The component's name consists of a term describing the component, followed by the **component type**. The first part of the name may differ depending on the component's purpose. 
This table lists the available types:
