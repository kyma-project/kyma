# Namespace controller

## Overview

This controller injects limit ranges, resource quotas, and default roles into each Namespace that you create.

Developers create default roles from a roles template that they first define in a Namespace inside the Kubernetes cluster.
At the time of cluster provisioning, developers might define the roles in the `3-bootstrap-roles.yaml` file. The controller looks for roles labeled as `env=true` at the creation of the new Namespace. Next, the controller copies the roles to the new Namespace.

Limit range configuration is required. These environment variables provide the configuration:
* `APP_LIMIT_RANGE_MEMORY_DEFAULT_REQUEST`
* `APP_LIMIT_RANGE_MEMORY_DEFAULT`
* `APP_LIMIT_RANGE_MEMORY_MAX`

Each Kubernetes environment has a `ResourceQuota` configured with standard quantities (such as 1G1 or 256Mi) that are set in the following required configuration values:
* `APP_RESOURCE_QUOTA_REQUESTS_MEMORY`
* `APP_RESOURCE_QUOTA_LIMITS_MEMORY`

## Prerequisites

 - A working Golang installation
 - Minikube
 - kubectl
 - Docker

### Build to run on Kubernetes

Use the following commands to prepare to run on Kubernetes. Run them in the following order:

 - `dep ensure`
 - `export GOOS=linux`
 - `go build -o namespace-controller cmd/controller/main.go`

### Build a Docker image

Make sure that the [build](#build-to-run-on-kubernetes) step is complete. Run the following commands:

- `cp ./namespace-controller deploy/controller/namespace-controller`
- `docker build -t namespace-controller:{your_tag} deploy/controller`

Make sure the image is built:

- `docker images | grep namespace-controller`

### Run the image locally inside Kyma

This section describes how to run Kyma with an updated namespace-controller image. The procedure is useful in case the component has been modified and needs to be tested.

Read the main [Kyma project README.md](../../README.md). By default, the system runs the namespace-controller image specified in the [4-deployment.yaml](../../resources/core/charts/namespace-controller/templates/4-deployment.yaml) file. You can provide your own image by following one of the procedures.

#### Docker registry

 If you have access to an external Docker registry, build your Docker image, push it to the registry and modify the [4-deployment.yaml](../../resources/core/charts/namespace-controller/templates/4-deployment.yaml) file by swapping the image version. Follow the [instructions](../../docs/kyma/docs/030-inst-local-installation-from-release.md) to run Kyma as usual.

#### Minikube built in Docker daemon

In case you have no access to a Docker registry, use Minikubeâ€™s built in Docker daemon that keeps images for running containers:

 1. Modify the [4-deployment.yaml](../../resources/core/charts/namespace-controller/templates/4-deployment.yaml) file by swapping the image version.
```
image: namespace-controller:my_tag
```

2. [Start Kyma installation as usual](../../docs/kyma/docs/030-inst-local-installation-from-release.md).

3. Run the following command to set up the Docker environment variables so a Docker client can communicate with the Minikube Docker daemon:
```
eval $(minikube docker-env)
```

4. [Build your Docker image](#build-a-docker-image) with the tag you specified in the first step. Wait for the installation to complete.
