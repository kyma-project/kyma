# Terminology

The project documentation mentions different types of resolvers.

- **Resolver** is a term related to GraphQL itself. It is a Function that defines what data to return for a specific [field](http://graphql.org/learn/queries/#fields).
- **Resolver type** is a custom type named `Resolver` that contains methods, which essentially are resolver Functions.
- **Resource resolver** is a resolver type that contains methods related to the specific resource.
