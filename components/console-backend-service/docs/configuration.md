## Configure logger verbosity level

This application uses `glog` to log messages. Pass command line arguments described in the [glog.go](https://github.com/golang/glog/blob/master/glog.go) document to customize the log, such as log level and output.

For example:

```bash
go run main.go --stderrthreshold=INFO -logtostderr=false
```
