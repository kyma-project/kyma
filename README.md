## Overview

**Kyma** `/kee-ma/` Kyma is an opinionated set of Kubernetes-based modular building blocks, including all necessary capabilities to develop and run enterprise-grade cloud-native applications. It is the open path to the SAP ecosystem supporting business scenarios end-to-end.

Kyma is an actively maintained open-source project supported by SAP. The Kyma project is also a foundation of SAP BTP, Kyma runtime which is a part of SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP). You can use Kyma modules in your own Kubernetes cluster, or try the managed version from SAP BTP with a ready-to-use Kubernetes cluster powered by Gardener.

Kyma modules offer various functionalities, such as:

- [Serverless](https://kyma-project.io/#/serverless-manager/user/README) development platform to run lightweight Functions in a cost-efficient and scalable way
- [System connectivity](https://kyma-project.io/#/application-connector-manager/user/README) that provides an endpoint to securely register Events and APIs of external applications
- [Istio](https://kyma-project.io/#/istio/user/README) for service-to-service communication and proxying
- [Service Management](https://kyma-project.io/#/btp-manager/user/README) to use the built-in cloud services from such cloud providers as GCP, Azure, and AWS
- Secure [API exposure](https://kyma-project.io/#/api-gateway/user/README)
- Collection and shipment of telemetry data to observability backends using the [Telemetry module](https://kyma-project.io/#/telemetry-manager/user/README)
- CLI supported by the intuitive UI through which you can connect your application to a Kubernetes cluster
