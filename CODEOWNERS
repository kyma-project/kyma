# This file provides an overview of code owners in the `kyma` repository.

# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
# The last matching pattern has the most precedence.
# For more details read the following article on GitHub: https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/.

# These are the default owners for the whole content of the `kyma` repository. The default owners are automatically added as reviewers when you open a pull request unless different owners are specified in the file.
