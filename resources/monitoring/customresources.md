Custom resource definitions for `crd-alertmanager.yaml`, `crd-podmonitor.yaml`, and `crd-servicemonitor.yaml` have been moved to the `resources/cluster-essentials/templates` folder and will be maintained in the chart. Along with the next update of the Prometheus Operator chart, update the listed files in the [Cluster Essentials](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/tree/master/resources/cluster-essentials) chart.
