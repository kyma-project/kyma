    # This is a fully documented Kiali custom resource yaml file.
    # It can be used to tell the Kiali Operator to install Kiali.
    #
    # This is actually an empty Kiali CR, however, it provides
    # documentation on all available settings.
    # In each documented section, you will see a "---" marker;
    # below that marker you will see the names of the settings along
    # with their default values. If the setting is not defined by
    # default, its name will be prefixed with "#".

    #
    # A list of additional details that Kiali will look for in annotations and display, for every workloads and services, in their respective details pages.
    # It can typically be used to inject some CI meta-data or documentation links into Kiali views.
    # Each item in the list is an object with "annotation", "title" and "icon_annotation" fields to indicate which annotation Kiali needs to look for, and how it should be displayed.
    # "icon_annotation" is optional and would display an icon next to the text.
    # At the moment, the value of the icon annotation can only be one of "rest", "grpc" or "graphql", or be ignored.
    # By default, this settings recognizes API Documention links via annotation "kiali.io/api-spec" and icon-annotation "kiali.io/api-type".
    # For example, it would make Kiali recognize these annotations in a service or a workload definition (Deployment, StatefulSet, etc.) to display the appropriate link and text:
    #    annotations:
    #      kiali.io/api-spec: http://link/to/my/doc
    #      kiali.io/api-type: rest
    # Should you change this setting for your own custom annotations, keep in mind that it would override the current default.
    # So you would have to copy the "API Documentation" setting as shown above if you want to preserve these links.

    auth:
    #
    # Determines what authentication strategy to use when users log into Kiali.
    # Options are "anonymous", "token", "openshift", "openid".
    # Choose "anonymous" to allow full access to Kiali without requiring any credentials.
    # Choose "token" to allow access to Kiali using service account tokens, which controls
    #  access based on RBAC roles assigned to the service account.
    # Choose "openshift" to use the OpenShift OAuth login which controls access based on
    #  the individual's  RBAC roles in OpenShift. Not valid for non-OpenShift environments.
    # Choose "openid" to enable OpenID connect based authentication. Your cluster is required to
    #  be configured to accept the tokens issued by your IdP. There are additional required
    #  configurations for this strategy. See below for the additional OpenID configuration section.
    # When empty, its value will default to "openshift" on OpenShift and "token" on Kubernetes.
    #    ---
      strategy: "anonymous"
    #
    # When "openid" strategy is chosen for authentication, you will need to fill some
    # required configurations in the following openid section. The "openid" authentication strategy
    # assumes that your Kubernetes cluster is properly configured to accept OpenID connect
    # tokens and delegates token validation to the cluster's API Server. Thus, "openid" strategy
    # won't work without the proper configuration on your Kubernetes cluster
    # (see https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#configuring-the-api-server).
    # In case you are using a managed Kubernetes and your provider does not support configuring OpenID
    # integration, a workaround is to use API proxies (like kube-oidc-proxy).
    #
    # If you are using an API proxy for the cluster API, you will need to specify the URI of the proxy
    # in the `api_proxy` attribute, and provide the certificate authority file in the
    # `api_proxy_ca_data` attribute as a base64 encoded string.
    #
    # The "openid" strategy should NOT be used when installing Kiali in OpenShift. In this case, you
    # still should use "openshift" strategy and, in turn, setup OpenShift to use your IdP. For
    # OpenShift 4.4, you can find related docs here: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/authentication/identity_providers/configuring-oidc-identity-provider.html
    #
    # Kiali requires that your IdP allows the Implicit Flow grant. The 'issuer_uri' and 'client_id' attributes
    # are required values and must match your OpenId-Connect Kubernetes configuration. The 'username_claim'
    # is optional, but must match the value configured in your cluster (default value is "sub").
    #
    # You can, optionally, specify an 'authorization_endpoint' which is the URI where users will
    # be redirected to login and authorize access to Kiali. If you don't specify it, Kiali will try
    # to discover it using the 'issuer_uri'.
    #
    # By default, Kiali will ask for "openid" (forced), "profile" and "email" scopes when asking
    # for authentication to the OpenID provider. These are standard OpenID scopes. If this doesn't
    # suit your needs, you can change the 'scopes' setting as long as your cluster will accept
    # the issued token.
    #
    # When users are logging in, Kiali will wait at most 5 minutes after the "Login" button is pressed
    # in Kiali and redirected to the OpenID provider. If users don't login within 5 minutes, Kiali will
    # reject login even if the user authenticates successfully. You can change this time by adjusting
    # the 'authentication_timeout' option.
    #
    # If your OpenID provider is using a certificate signed by an unknown CA, adjust the 'insecure_skip_verify_tls'
    # to disable the certificate verification. Remember this should be for testing purposes only.
