    # kiali_cr.yaml
    #
    # This is a fully documented Kiali custom resource yaml file.
    # It can be used to tell the Kiali Operator to install Kiali.
    #
    # This is actually an empty Kiali CR, however, it provides
    # documentation on all available settings.
    # In each documented section, you will see a "---" marker;
    # below that marker you will see the names of the settings along
    # with their default values. If the setting is not defined by
    # default, its name will be prefixed with "#".

    #  - title: "API Documentation"
    #    annotation: "kiali.io/api-spec"
    #    icon_annotation: "kiali.io/api-type"
    #
    # A list of additional details that Kiali will look for in annotations and display, for every workload and service, in their respective details pages.
    # It can typically be used to inject some CI metadata or documentation links into Kiali views.
    # Each item in the list is an object with "annotation", "title" and "icon_annotation" fields to indicate which annotation Kiali needs to look for, and how it should be displayed.
    # "icon_annotation" is optional and would display an icon next to the text.
    # At the moment, the value of the icon annotation can only be one of "rest", "grpc" or "graphql"; otherwise, it is ignored.
    # By default, these settings recognize API Documentation links via annotation "kiali.io/api-spec" and icon-annotation "kiali.io/api-type".
    # For example, it would make Kiali recognize these annotations in a service or a workload definition (Deployment, StatefulSet, etc.) to display the appropriate link and text:
    #    annotations:
    #      kiali.io/api-spec: http://link/to/my/doc
    #      kiali.io/api-type: rest
    # Should you change this setting for your own custom annotations, keep in mind that it would override the current default.
    # So you would have to copy the "API Documentation" setting as shown above if you want to preserve these links.
