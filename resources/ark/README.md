# Ark

## Overview

Ark is a tool to back up and restore Kubernetes resources and persistent volumes. It can create backups on demand or on schedule, filter objects which should be backed up, and set TTL (time to live) for stored backups. For more details, see the official [documentation](https://heptio.github.io/velero/v0.9.0/).

## Details

The Ark installation contains only the configuration for storage providers. The Backup custom resource defines the backup content and scope configuration. To comply with the specific Ark architecture, Kyma delivers tested sample files you can use to run the [backup process](https://kyma-project.io/docs/components/backup/). Add all components which store data in this configuration to allow administrators to set up a proper backup process.

### Add components to backup

All Kubernetes resources in the user Namespaces are backed up by default. However, you must add all data this backup does not cover, or data stored in the system Namespaces, to the configuration files. These serve as a testing configuration. For details on configuration attributes, see [this documentation](https://velero.io/docs/v1.0.0/api-types/backup/).

If Ark's functionality is not sufficient, you can extend it using [plugins](https://heptio.github.io/velero/v0.10.0/plugins) and [hooks](https://heptio.github.io/velero/v0.10.0/hooks). Ark plugins are stored in [`tools`](tools/ark-plugins) directory, and extend Ark without being a part of the binary. Hooks are commands executed inside containers and Pods during the backup process. You can define them in your backup configuration.

## End-to-end tests

For details on end-to-end tests for backup and restore, see [this](../../tests/end-to-end/backup-restore-test/README.md) document.
