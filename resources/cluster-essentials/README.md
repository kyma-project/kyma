# Cluster Essentials

## Overview

The `cluster-essentials` folder contains a chart with essential resources for the installation of all components in Kyma.
The `files` subfolder contains CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs) of Kyma components.

Starting from Kyma version 2.19, the Cluster Essentials component is no longer available for newly created clusters.
