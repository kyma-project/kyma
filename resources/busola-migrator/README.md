# Busola Migrator

## Overview

Busola Migrator is an HTTP server that serves a static webpage. It allows for migrating business user permissions from the SAP authentication and authorization service (XSUAA) to in-cluster roles. It also redirects the users that try to access the Console UI from the previous Kyma Console link to the new Busola URL.
