# Knative Build

## Overview

>**NOTE**: This is an experimental module.

Build is a custom resource provided by Knative. Use it to build container images from the source code and push them to docker registry of preference. Youn can later use the knative-serving to pull this docker image to start lambdas. For details, see [knative build](https://github.com/knative/docs/tree/master/docs/build).

For details on how to leverage the full potential of knative-builds, see [samples](https://github.com/knative/build/tree/master/test).
