# The REB informs the Service Catalog that its available services changed and should be relisted.
# Due to performance reason, many actions (like adding, updating, or deleting Applications)
# which happen during the period defined in `brokerRelistDurationWindow`
# result in a single Service Catalog relist trigger.
#
# Note: We have hardcoded resynchronization period for Applications informers to 30minutes.
# Because of that every 30minutes update action for all defined Applications is triggered,
# which means that the Service Catalog is triggered to perform relist action.
