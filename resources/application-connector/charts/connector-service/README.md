- **internalAPIPort** - This port exposes the Connector Service within Kubernetes cluster. The default port is `8080`.
- **namespace** - Namespace where Connector Service is deployed. The default Namespace is `kyma-integration`.
- **tokenLength** - Length of registration tokens. The default value is `64`.
- **appTokenExpirationMinutes** - Time after which tokens for applications expire and are no longer valid. The default value is `5` minutes.
- **runtimeTokenExpirationMinutes** - Time after which tokens for runtimes expire and are no longer valid. The default value is `10` minutes.
- **caSecretName** - Name of the secret which contains the root Certificate Authority (CA). The default value is `nginx-auth-ca`.
- **requestLogging** - Flag for logging incoming requests. It is set to `False` by default.

- **gatewayHost** - Host at which gateway service is accessible The default value is `gateway.wormhole.cluster.kyma.cx`.
- **certificateProtectedHost** - Host secured with client certificate, used for certificate renewal. The default host is `gateway.wormhole.cluster.kyma.cx`.
- **appsInfoURL** - URL at which management information for applications is available. If not provided, it bases on `connectorServiceHost`.
- **runtimesInfoURL** - URL at which management information for runtimes is available. If not provided, it bases on `connectorServiceHost`.
- **certificateValidityTime** - Validity time of certificates issued by this service. The default value is 90 days.
- **central** - Determines whether the Connector Service works in the central mode.
