# Helm Broker

## Overview

Helm Broker provides bundles in the [Service Catalog](../../../service-catalog/README.md). A bundle is an abstraction layer over a Helm chart which enables you to provide more information about the Helm chart. For example, a bundle can provide plan definitions or binding details. Service Catalog requires this information. Bundles are services available in Service Catalog.

Helm Broker implements the [Service Broker API](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/master/spec.md). For more information about the Service Brokers, see the [Service Brokers overview](../../../../docs/service-brokers/docs/001-overview-service-brokers.md) documentation. Find the details about the Helm Broker in the [docs](../../../../docs/service-brokers/docs) repository.
