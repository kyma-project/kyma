etcd:
  # By default etcd subchart will be release with name "core-etcd", and it's to much generic
  # but currently there is no way to pass to the etcd subchart a parent Release.Name, see https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/issues/2506
  # so to make it more verbose I've added nameOverride and now the release name will be "core-helm-broker-etcd"
