## Whether to register this broker with the Kubernetes Service Catalog. If true,
## the Kubernetes Service Catalog must already be installed on the cluster.
## Marking this option false is useful for scenarios wherein one wishes to host
## the broker in a separate cluster than the Service Catalog (or other client)
## that will access it.
registerBroker: true

service:
  ## Type of service; valid values are "ClusterIP", "LoadBalancer", and
  ## "NodePort". "ClusterIP" is sufficient in the average case where a service
  ## catalog installation in the same cluster is the only client that needs to
  ## communicate with this broker. i.e. The broker does not need to receive
  ## inbound requests from outside the cluster.
  type: ClusterIP
  ## Further configuration if service is of type "NodePort"
  nodePort:
    ## Available port in allowable range (e.g. 30000 - 32767 on minikube)
    port: 30080

## Basic auth credentials that can later be used to access this broker
# TODO implement secure way of passing this value (integration with vault)
basicAuth:
  username: admin
  password: p4ssw0rd

modules:
  ## Minimum stability required for a module's services and plans to be listed
  ## in the broker's catalog. For production, use STABLE only!
  minStability: EXPERIMENTAL

## Redis configuration 
redis:
  ## Should a containerized Redis server be included in the Helm release?
  embedded: true

  ## Required if not embedded
  host: 

  ## If not embedded, specifies the port for the client to connect to.
  ## 6380 is the port often used for Redis secured using TLS.
  port: 6380

  # can't be generated here and this value is used in two places: here and in sub-chart (refactoring needed)
  # TODO implement secure way of passing this value (integration with vault)
  redisPassword: p4ssw0rd

  ## If not emnedded, specifies whether to use a secure connection to the
  ## remote Redis host
  enableTls: true
