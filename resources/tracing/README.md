# Tracing

## Overview

Tracing functionality is provided by [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) which is a tracing tool for microservice-based distributed systems.

## Details

The Envoy sidecar uses Jaeger to trace the request flow in the Istio service mesh. Istio and Envoy use the Zipkin protocol to communicate with the tracing backend. Jaeger provides compatibility with the Zipkin protocol. This allows you to use Zipkin protocol and clients in Istio, Envoy, and the Kyma services.

## Installation

While you install Jaeger automatically during cluster installation, local Jaeger installation is optional. To run Jaeger locally, install it on a Kyma instance and run using Helm.
