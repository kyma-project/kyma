Service Manager Broker Proxy for Kubernetes

Changes added to the original upstream chart:
1. In deployment.yaml file such annotation was added:
    ```yaml
    annotations:
            sidecar.istio.io/inject: "false" 
    ```
2. In __helpers.tpl_ file the `{{- printf "%s-%s" .Release.Name $name | trunc 63 | trimSuffix "-" -}}` was replaced with `{{- .Release.Name | trunc 63 | trimSuffix "-" -}}`. As a result we have shorten and more readable names for Deployments, Secrets, ConfigMaps etc.

## Introduction

This helm chart bootstraps the Service Broker Proxy for Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

* `helm` is installed and configured. (version > 3)
* `service-catalog` is installed and configured in the Kubernetes cluster.
* The cluster is registered in the Service Manager as a platform.

You can register the cluster in Service Manager by executing the following command:
```sh
smctl register-platform <cluster-name> kubernetes
```
**Note:** Store the returned credentials in a safe place as you will not be able to fetch them again from Service Manager.

You can get `smctl` tool from https://github.com/Peripli/service-manager-cli.

## Installation

### Add Peripli helm repo
```bash
helm repo add peripli 'https://peripli.github.io'
```

### Instal Service Manager agent

```bash
kubectl create namespace service-broker-proxy
helm install service-broker-proxy peripli/service-broker-proxy-k8s \
  --namespace service-broker-proxy \
  --version <VERSION> \
  --set config.sm.url=<SM_URL> \
  --set sm.user=<USER> \
  --set sm.password=<PASSWORD>
```

**Note:** Make sure you substitute &lt;SM_URL&gt; with the Service Manager url, &lt;USER&gt; and &lt;PASSWORD&gt; with the credentials returned from cluster registration in Service Manager (see above).
Substitute \<VERSION> with the specific version you require. If this is not set, the latest version is used.

To use your own images you can set `image.repository`, `image.tag` and `image.pullPolicy` to the helm install command. In case your image is pulled from a private repository, you can use
`image.pullsecret` to name a secret containing the credentials.

## Configuration

The following table lists some of the configurable parameters of the service broker proxy for K8S chart and their default values.
