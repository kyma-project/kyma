    #  We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious
    #  choice for the user. This also increases chances charts run on environments with little
    #  resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
    #  lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.
