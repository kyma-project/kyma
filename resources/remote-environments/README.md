## Overview

A Remote Environment (RE) is a representation of an external solution connected to Kyma. The Application Connector manages the traffic, connection, security, and Events of REs. It is a proprietary implementation that consists of four services.
Read the [Application Connector documentation](../../docs/application-connector/docs/001-overview-application-connector.md) for more details regarding the implementation.

## Details

This directory contains the Remote Environment Helm chart that creates a new RE. Additionally, the chart installs the Gateway Service and all of the Ingresses required to access Application Connector services in the context of the created RE. A single RE allows to connect a single external solution to Kyma.

### Customize the Gateway Service installation

Edit the [`values`](./values.yaml) file to customize the installation of the Gateway Service.
You can adjust these parameters:

- **proxyPort** - This port proxies calls from services and lambdas to an external solution. The default port is `8080`.
- **externalAPIPort** - This port exposes the Gateway API to an external solution. The default port is `8081`.
- **eventsTargetURL** - The URL to proxy incoming events. The default URL is `http://localhost:9000`.
- **remoteEnvironment** - The RE to read and write information about the services. The default RE is `default-ec`.
- **namespace** - The Namespace to which you deploy the Gateway. The default Namespace is `kyma-system`.
- **requestTimeout** - A time-out for requests sent through the Gateway. Provide it in seconds. The default time-out is `1`.
- **skipVerify** - The flag to skip the verification of certificates for the proxy targets. The default value is `false`.

Additionally, you can adjust the parameters used in the communication with the Event Service:
- **sourceId** - The Remote Environment name is used as the source id.
