# MinIO

## Overview

MinIO is an open source object storage server with Amazon S3 compatible API. Kyma provides MinIO as a core component to store static content. For example, documentation, images, or videos. The size of an object can range from a few KBs to a maximum of 5TB. In the long term, you can replace MinIO with an external solution, such as AWS S3.
