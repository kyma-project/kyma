# Connector service acceptance tests

## Overview

This project contains the acceptance tests for Connector Service.
The tests are written in Go. Run them as standard Go tests.

## Usage

This section provides information on building and versioning of the Docker image, as well as configuring the Kyma.

### Running locally

1. `helm ls` and pick a release you want to test.
```sh
$ helm ls
NAME               	REVISION	UPDATED                 	STATUS  	CHART                        	NAMESPACE
cluster-essentials 	1       	Tue May 22 10:47:14 2018	DEPLOYED	kyma-cluster-essentials-0.0.1	kyma-system
core               	2       	Tue May 22 11:00:03 2018	DEPLOYED	core-0.0.1                   	kyma-system
ec-default         	1       	Tue May 22 11:00:24 2018	DEPLOYED	gateway-0.0.1                	kyma-integration
hmc-default        	1       	Tue May 22 11:00:07 2018	DEPLOYED	gateway-0.0.1                	kyma-integration
istio              	1       	Tue May 22 10:47:21 2018	DEPLOYED	istio-0.5.1                  	istio-system
prometheus-operator	1       	Tue May 22 10:48:10 2018	DEPLOYED	prometheus-operator-0.18.1   	kyma-system
```

2. Let's say we pick `ec-default` release. In order to test it, run `helm test ec-default`.
```sh
$ helm test ec-default
RUNNING: test-ec-default-acceptance
PASSED: test-ec-default-acceptance
```

3. To see the logs, find the pod, that ran tests using `kubectl get po --show-all`. It'll be in `Completed` state.
```sh
$ kubectl get po --show-all
NAME                                  READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
ec-default-gateway-5dffff49f-drr7n    2/2       Running     0          1h
hmc-default-gateway-669965894-5wwv8   2/2       Running     0          3h
test-ec-default-acceptance            0/1       Completed   0          7m # <<<<<< this one
```

and then just

```sh
kci logs test-ec-default-acceptance
=== RUN   TestGatewayHealth
=== RUN   TestGatewayHealth/SF_Gateway
--- PASS: TestGatewayHealth (0.00s)
    --- PASS: TestGatewayHealth/SF_Gateway (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestApiMetadata
--- PASS: TestApiMetadata (0.00s)
PASS
ok  	github.com/kyma-project/gateway-tests/test	0.003s
