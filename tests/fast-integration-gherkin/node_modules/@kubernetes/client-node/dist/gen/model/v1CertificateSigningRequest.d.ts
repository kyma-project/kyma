* CertificateSigningRequest objects provide a mechanism to obtain x509 certificates by submitting a certificate signing request, and having it asynchronously approved and issued.  Kubelets use this API to obtain:  1. client certificates to authenticate to kube-apiserver (with the \"kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client-kubelet\" signerName).  2. serving certificates for TLS endpoints kube-apiserver can connect to securely (with the \"kubernetes.io/kubelet-serving\" signerName).  This API can be used to request client certificates to authenticate to kube-apiserver (with the \"kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client\" signerName), or to obtain certificates from custom non-Kubernetes signers.
