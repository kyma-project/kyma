This produces the assured concurrency value (ACV) --- the number of requests that may be executing at a time --- for each such priority level:              ACV(l) = ceil( SCL * ACS(l) / ( sum[priority levels k] ACS(k) ) )  bigger numbers of ACS mean more reserved concurrent requests (at the expense of every other PL).
