## Documentation

The library exposes what are essentially steps necessary to be done by a relying party consuming
OpenID Connect Authorization Server responses or wrappers around requests to its endpoints. Aside
from a generic OpenID Connect [passport][passport-url] strategy it does not expose neither express
or koa middlewares. Those can however be built using the exposed API.

## Install

Node.js version **>=12.0.0** is recommended, but **^10.19.0** lts/dubnium is also supported.

```console
npm install openid-client
```

## Quick start

Discover an Issuer configuration using its published .well-known endpoints
```js
const { Issuer } = require('openid-client');
Issuer.discover('https://accounts.google.com') // => Promise
  .then(function (googleIssuer) {
    console.log('Discovered issuer %s %O', googleIssuer.issuer, googleIssuer.metadata);
  });
```

### Authorization Code Flow

Authorization Code flow is for obtaining Access Tokens (and optionally Refresh Tokens) to use with
third party APIs securely as well as Refresh Tokens. In this quick start your application also uses
PKCE instead of `state` parameter for CSRF protection.

Create a Client instance for that issuer's authorization server intended for Authorization Code
flow.

**See the [documentation][documentation] for full API details.**

```js
const client = new googleIssuer.Client({
  client_id: 'zELcpfANLqY7Oqas',
  client_secret: 'TQV5U29k1gHibH5bx1layBo0OSAvAbRT3UYW3EWrSYBB5swxjVfWUa1BS8lqzxG/0v9wruMcrGadany3',
  redirect_uris: ['http://localhost:3000/cb'],
  response_types: ['code'],
  // id_token_signed_response_alg (default "RS256")
  // token_endpoint_auth_method (default "client_secret_basic")
}); // => Client
```

When you want to have your end-users authorize you need to send them to the issuer's
`authorization_endpoint`. Consult the web framework of your choice on how to redirect but here's how
to get the authorization endpoint's URL with parameters already encoded in the query to redirect
to.

```js
const { generators } = require('openid-client');
const code_verifier = generators.codeVerifier();
// store the code_verifier in your framework's session mechanism, if it is a cookie based solution
// it should be httpOnly (not readable by javascript) and encrypted.

const code_challenge = generators.codeChallenge(code_verifier);

client.authorizationUrl({
  scope: 'openid email profile',
  resource: 'https://my.api.example.com/resource/32178',
  code_challenge,
  code_challenge_method: 'S256',
});
```

When end-users are redirected back to your `redirect_uri` your application consumes the callback and
passes in the `code_verifier` to include it in the authorization code grant token exchange.
```js
const params = client.callbackParams(req);
client.callback('https://client.example.com/callback', params, { code_verifier }) // => Promise
  .then(function (tokenSet) {
    console.log('received and validated tokens %j', tokenSet);
    console.log('validated ID Token claims %j', tokenSet.claims());
  });
```

You can then call the `userinfo_endpoint`.
```js
client.userinfo(access_token) // => Promise
  .then(function (userinfo) {
    console.log('userinfo %j', userinfo);
  });
```

And later refresh the tokenSet if it had a `refresh_token`.
```js
client.refresh(refresh_token) // => Promise
  .then(function (tokenSet) {
    console.log('refreshed and validated tokens %j', tokenSet);
    console.log('refreshed ID Token claims %j', tokenSet.claims());
  });
```

### Implicit ID Token Flow

Implicit `response_type=id_token` flow is perfect for simply authenticating your end-users, assuming
the only job you want done is authenticating the user and then relying on your own session mechanism
with no need for accessing any third party APIs with an Access Token from the Authorization Server.

Create a Client instance for that issuer's authorization server intended for ID Token implicit flow.

**See the [documentation][documentation] for full API details.**
```js
const client = new googleIssuer.Client({
  client_id: 'zELcpfANLqY7Oqas',
  redirect_uris: ['http://localhost:3000/cb'],
  response_types: ['id_token'],
  // id_token_signed_response_alg (default "RS256")
}); // => Client
```

When you want to have your end-users authorize you need to send them to the issuer's
`authorization_endpoint`. Consult the web framework of your choice on how to redirect but here's how
to get the authorization endpoint's URL with parameters already encoded in the query to redirect
to.

```js
const { generators } = require('openid-client');
const nonce = generators.nonce();
// store the nonce in your framework's session mechanism, if it is a cookie based solution
// it should be httpOnly (not readable by javascript) and encrypted.

client.authorizationUrl({
  scope: 'openid email profile',
  response_mode: 'form_post',
  nonce,
});
```

When end-users hit back your `redirect_uri` with a POST (authorization request included `form_post`
response mode) your application consumes the callback and passes the `nonce` in to include it in the
ID Token verification steps.
```js
// assumes req.body is populated from your web framework's body parser
const params = client.callbackParams(req);
client.callback('https://client.example.com/callback', params, { nonce }) // => Promise
  .then(function (tokenSet) {
    console.log('received and validated tokens %j', tokenSet);
    console.log('validated ID Token claims %j', tokenSet.claims());
  });
```

### Device Authorization Grant (Device Flow)

[RFC8628 - OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant (Device Flow)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628)
is started by starting a Device Authorization Request.

```js
const handle = await client.deviceAuthorization();
console.log('User Code: ', handle.user_code);
console.log('Verification URI: ', handle.verification_uri);
console.log('Verification URI (complete): ', handle.verification_uri_complete);
```

The handle represents a Device Authorization Response with the `verification_uri`, `user_code` and
other defined response properties.

You will display the instructions to the end-user and have him directed at `verification_uri` or
`verification_uri_complete`, afterwards you can start polling for the Device Access Token Response.
```js
const tokenSet = await handle.poll();
console.log('received tokens %j', tokenSet);
```

This will poll in the defined interval and only resolve with a TokenSet once one is received. This
will handle the defined `authorization_pending` and `slow_down` "soft" errors and continue polling
but upon any other error it will reject. With tokenSet received you can throw away the handle.

## Electron Support

Electron >=v6.0.0 runtime is supported to the extent of the crypto engine BoringSSL feature parity
with standard Node.js OpenSSL.

## FAQ

#### Semver?

**Yes.** Everything that's either exported in the TypeScript definitions file or
[documented][documentation] is subject to
[Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). The rest is to be considered
private API and is subject to change between any versions.

#### How do I use it outside of Node.js

It is **only built for ^10.19.0 || >=12.0.0 Node.js** environment - including openid-client in
browser-environment targeted projects is not supported and may result in unexpected results.

#### How to make the client send client_id and client_secret in the body?

See [Client Authentication Methods (docs)][documentation-methods].

#### Can I adjust the HTTP timeout?

See [Customizing (docs)](https://github.com/panva/node-openid-client/blob/master/docs/README.md#customizing).

#### How can I debug the requests and responses?
