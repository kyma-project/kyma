     *   converted into a data-property when first accessed. This avoids an up-front performance penalty for
     *   all existing calls to `RegExp.prototype.exec` at the cost of spec compliance. This is the default.
     * - `"spec-compliant"` - Uses a more spec-complaint behavior that evaluates and stores `"indices"`
     *   immediately as a data-property. This can result in a performance penalty for existing calls to
     *   `RegExp.prototype.exec` that may not be already accessing `"indices"`.
