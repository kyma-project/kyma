# Function Controller Integration Tests

## Overview

The project is a test scenario for the Function Controller. It creates a sample Function, exposes it using an APIRule, and sends `GET` requests to the Function to check if it is accessible from the cluster and outside of the cluster.

## Prerequisites

Use the following tools to set up the project:

- [Go v1.19](https://golang.org)
- [Kyma CLI](https://github.com/kyma-project/cli)

## Usage

### Run a local version

To run integration tests, follow these instructions:

1. Install [Kyma](https://kyma-project.io/#/04-operation-guides/operations/02-install-kyma).
2. Enable kubectl proxy:

   ```bash
   kubectl proxy
   ```

3. Run test with given scenario. You can also specify test suite to run. If not specified, all test suites are run within scenario.
   ```bash
   go run cmd/main.go {scenario} --test-suite {test-suite}
   ```

### Environment variables

Use the following environment variables to configure the application:
