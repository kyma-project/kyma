# Function Controller Integration Tests

## Overview

The project is a test scenario for the Function Controller. It creates a sample function, exposes it using an API Rule, and sends `GET` requests to the function to check if it is accessible from the cluster and outside of the cluster.

## Prerequisites

Use the following tools to set up the project:

- [Go v1.13](https://golang.org)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Kyma CLI](https://github.com/kyma-project/cli)

## Usage

### Run a local version

To run integration tests, follow these instructions:

1. [Install](https://kyma-project.io/docs/master/root/kyma/#installation-install-kyma-locally) Kyma.
2. Build the test image directly on the Docker engine of the Minikube node without pushing it to a registry. Run:

   ```bash
   eval $(minikube docker-env)
   make build-image
   ```

   Alternatively, build the image and push it to a registry, such as Docker Hub.

3. Edit the TestDefinition CR and update its `.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image` field to `function-controller-test:latest` using this command:

   ```bash
   kubectl edit testdefinitions.testing.kyma-project.io -n kyma-system function-controller
   ```

4. Run the integration test. The command creates a test suite with a name in a form of `test-{ID}`. Run:

   ```bash
   kyma test run function-controller
   ```

5. Get the test result using this command:

   ```bash
   kubectl logs -n kyma-system oct-tp-test-{ID}-function-controller-0 tests
   ```

### Build a production version

To build the production Docker image, run this command:

```bash
make build-image
```

### Environment variables

Use the following environment variables to configure the application:

Those can be supplied to [this](../../resources/serverless/templates/tests/test.yaml) file before installing Kyma. After you install Kyma, you can also edit the TestDefinition CR using this command:

```bash
kubectl edit testdefinitions.testing.kyma-project.io -n kyma-system function-controller
```

## Development
